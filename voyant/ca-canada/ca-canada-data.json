La\nbranca legislativa del Governo\nconsiste di un Senato formato da\n96 membri, 24 dei quali rappre\nsentano la provincia di Quebec\ned un egual n\u00f9mero le Provin\ncie dell'West e dell'Ontario.

C. D. Howe is the\nname \u2014 the Honourable C. D. Howe, to\ngive him his full due according to Canadian\ncustom and spelling. As Minister of Munitions\nand Supply, he is the Beaverbrook of Canada.\nHis powers over industry are almost un\nlimited. He can tell any Canadian manu\nfacturer what to produce, how much, to whom\nto sell it, and what he may get for it. No one\nman in our American defense setup has any\nsuch accumulation of arbitrary powers. Poten\ntially the man is a dictator, no less.\nBut the interview had not measured up to\nthat billing. The Minister didn\u2019t look like a\ndictator, act like a dictator or talk like a\ndictator. A ruddy-faced man in a rather\nrumpled gray business suit, he sat behind his\nnone-too-tidy desk and talked in the low\n\u2022 r \u00ab_\u2022__l!___1\nUiuiiuiuuc ui a uuauiiooiuaii luium^ an aiuiuai\nreport. And wHat he said was just about as\nimpersonal and unemotional as an annual\nreport. No fireworks, no histrionics, no boast\ning. Just facts, quietly and sometimes even\ncautiously enumerated, about what Canada\nhad done and was doing to create the tools\nof war.\nWhen I rose to leave, he came around from\nbehind his desk to shake hands, smiled, and\nsuddenly said, \u201cYou come from the state of\nMaine, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t realized my speech still smacked\nso much of Down East, and I expressed sur\nprise that he could spot me so accurately.\nHe grinned warmly. \u201cSome of my people\nused to live in Maine,\u201d he said. \"As a matter\nof fact, their name was Bartlett, too. Probably\nwe\u2019re cousins.\u201d\nCanada, starting almost from scratch, has become\na world-important arsenal. Behind this great teat\nis Massachusetts-born C. D. Howe, her industrial\nczar \u2014 a man all America can be proud ot\nby Arthur Bartlett\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014m > V-\u00abW \u2022\u25a0P'MHBH\nBritish Com Mr*\nHURRY. MC. D.\" inspects a precision-instrument plant \u2014 built on short notice\nI haven\u2019t searched the family tree for proof\nor disproof of blood kinship. That isn\u2019t im\nportant. What does matter is that this leader\nof Canada\u2019s industrial war effort, this un\ndictator-like dictator, is a living symbol of our\nnational cousinship to Canada. He isn\u2019t the\nsort to make speeches about the bonds\nbetween \u2018\u2018our two gr-r-reat countries.\u201d In\nfact, when I asked him if he had any message\nfor me to transmit to our people below the\nborder, he looked uncomfortable and mum\nbled something about appreciating our co\noperation. Yet a below-the-border accent\ncould warm him to personal comment, and\nbring a gleam of pleasure to his eyes. The\nunarmed border has long nourished roots of\nsentiment, understanding and kinship, run\nning both ways. This particular Canadian is\noutstanding proof of the fact, for he was bom\nin Waltham, Massachusetts. His very name\ncommemorates a great American hero. The C\nstands for Clarence, but the D stands for\nDecatur: Clarence Decatur Howe.\nHe Wasted No Time\nIf you seldom see his name spelled out,\nit is because he is the sort of man who, in\nCanada as in the United States, inevitably\nbecomes known by his initials. Going to \\\nCanada as a young graduate of the Massa\nchusetts Institute of Technology to teach civil\nengineering at Dalhouse University, he was\nvery soon developing his own engineering and\nconstruction firm of C. D. Howe & Company,\nwhich became the biggest builders of grain\nelevators in the Dominion \u2014 or on the North\nAmerican continent, for that matter. And\ntoday in Canada\u2019s biggest big business, war\nproduction (a business so big that it requires\n45 cents of every Canadian dollar earned to\nfinance it), the lingo forgetting a final okay on\na project or policy is: \u201cI\u2019ll check it with C. D.\u201d\nThis is the man who, in a year\u2019s time,\nengineered and directed the most rapid and\ngreatest industrial expansion that Canada has\never known. When France fell, in June of\n1940, Canada was turning out the merest\ndribble of war materials.

Some $520,000,000 has been\nspent on new plants and equipment. Half the\npeople employed in manufacturing in the\nDominion are engaged more or less directly on\nproduction associated with wartime needs.\nIn the present fiscal year, Canada will have\nspent considerably more than $2,000,000,000\non her war effort.

They will have a field\nmuch closer to home.\nA ban on the granting of titles was put into\nforce by the Canadian Parliament in 1919. The\nDominie 1 of Canada conveyed this fact to King\nGeorge V. A majority vote of the Parliament\npassed that ruling. There had been too many\ntitles conferred during the war years. It was\nnecessary in a country of democratic ideals to\ndo away with bought honorariums, was the\nconsensus of opinion. Yet so strong is the urge\nto hold a coveted letters patent granting a\nknighthood that the question of titles has been\nbefore Parliament ever since, and the\nsupporters for the restoration of such honors\nhave been growing.\nThe latest proponent of the title question is\nArmand Lavergne, French-Canadian Conser\nvative from the electoral riding of Montmagny,\nQuebec. He is Deputy Speaker of the House of\nCommons. He is strong for the restoration of\ntitles, with reservations. In fact, he even would\nhave Canada become the Kingdom of Canada\ninstead of her present status among the nations\nas the Dominion of Canada. He has a resolu\ntion to this effect to come up before Parlia\nment.\nTire Kingdom of Canada sounds very monar\nchical. In fact, so much so that when Canada\nbecame a unified country from coast to coast,\nthose who signed the confederation of the\nvarious British colonies north of the United\nStates boundary felt it would place Canada on\nan equal footing with Great Britain. In those\ndays that was unthought of. Today Canada\nhas that equality by the Westminster bill,\npassed recently in the British House of Parlia\nment. And for another reason the unifiers of\nCanada in 1867 did not name Canada a king\ndom. That was as a courtesy to the United\nStates, a republic. Whether a kingdom will\ncome into being north of the international\nboundary is a matter that will bear watching.\nTHE last attempt to restore the granting of\ntitles In Canada before Armand Lavergne\ntook up the cudgels was by the present\nCanadian secretary of state, C. H. Cahan,\nwidely known Montreal lawyer, who already\nbears after his name the coveted initials K. C.,\nwhich stand for King's Counsel. He came out\nwith the subject in 1928. It occupied quite an\namount of time early In the 1929 parliamentary\nsession. And when it came to a vote, the\nmajority still favored doing without more sirs\nand ladies, for a vote of nearly two to one sent\nthe resolution Into the discard.\nBut still the battle wages, with the latest\nstrides in its favor coming from the prime\nminister, Richard Bedford Bennett. He took on\nhimself the responsibility for allowing the\ngrand priory of the Knights of St. John of\nJerusalem to grant titles in the order to\nCanadians on the centenary celebrating the\nreturn of the priory to England. This organi\nsation, of which the King is the patron, is best\nknown in Canada as an organization teaching\nfirst aid to the injured and supplying uni\nformed ambulance men at large public gather\nings Premier Bennett allowed the granting\nof two knighthoods In this order and a number\nof other officers, despite the fact that the\nCanadian department of justice had ruled\npreviously that the order could not confer\ntitles on Canadians.\nA prominent Toronto King's Counsel, P. B.\nPet herstonhaugh, has circularized on expen\nsive vellum-embossed paper members of the\nCanadian Parliament on the question. He has\nbeen answered by a four-to-one majority in\nfavor of restoration of titles through his\nsuggested title commission for granting non\nheredltary titles.\nBy the latest figures there are only seven\nCanadian barons, seven baronets, 34 members\nof well-known British orders, which Include the\nSir Henry Drayton.\nSir John Aird.\nCanada Is Agitated Over Efforts to Repeal\n_ _ \u00ab\nLaw That Prohibits the Granting of Titles.\nDominion Is De\nserving of This\nRecognition, Say\nProponents, IVhile\nOth ers D eclare\nAgainst It.\nOrders of St. Michael and St George of the\nBritish Empire and of the Bath and 18\nKnights Bachelor.\nWhen the ban on titles was put into force it\nwas estimated that there were 109 titled\npersons in Canada and that within 36 years of\nthat date all these would have passed on.\nThere has been a great dwindling, as many\nhave died, and each year sees the number\ngrowing less. And while baronies are heredi\ntary titles and some of the baronets also can\npass on their title to their sons, if titles are not\nrestored there is a possibility of a Lindberghian\nreception for the last Canadian knight when\nhis only rival passes.\nWhile a fight is made for the restoration of\ntitles, there is opposition in plenty. With most\ninfluential persons in Canada the subject is\nanathema, whether that be in business, in the\nHouse of Commons or in the cabinet. The\nopposition is accounted for in several ways.\nSome claim the proximity of the United States;\nsome a too democratic soul. Canadians claim\nthat titles are too easy to produce. An offer\nto the party funds of the political party in\npower creates a title for the donor.\nThe Dominion does not want more big rail\nway builders, brewers, distillers and merchants\nto be granted a sir because they have enough\nmoney to help the political party. As that\nstrong Liberal woman member of the Dominion \u2019\nhouse, Agnes MePhail, said during the last\ndebate on the subject: \u2018\u2018The abolishment of\ntitles keeps those who did \u2018he damage from\nview of outsiders. We kr.c . uem without their\nhaving a handle.\u201d She said that titles should\nbe granted to the laborer or the farmer who\nmanages to get along with less than $1,000 a\nyear in these days.\nIt was during the war years that military\ndecorations, knighthoods, earldoms, dukedoms\nand all those other titular insignia were handed\nout in a p^pfundity which was nothing less\nthan wholesale. Canada had her share of the\nKing\u2019s birthday lists and of the New Year\nhonors. She addressed a note to the King,\nwho is the donor of all such titles, theoretically\nasking that he be good enough not to give\nCanadians any more titles which they could\npass on from father to son. That was In 1918.\nThe next year, after two sessions and a special\ncommittee had been at work on the problems,\nthey made the request a little more Inclusive.\nThis time not even with the Canadian prime\nminister's permission was the King asked to\ngrant titles of any chivalrous order, hereditary\nor otherwise. Since then no resident Cana\ndian has been given a title. In fact, even 29\nforeign honors have been refused.\nFeeling on the subject was so strong in 1918\nand 1919 that Sir Wilfred Laurier and other\ntitled personages throughout the country were\n\\-filing to make a bonfire of their patents. Sir\nWilfred suggested the idea of a public bonfire,\nwith all due respect to the King and the late\nQueen, who bad granted him his. There were\nmany who were willing to follow. But no such\nmeans were resorted to.\nSir Charles H. Cahan.\nTHERE is another side to the title question.\n' It has been brought out by some of those\nwho now favor granting titles. Men and\nwomen who contribute outstanding cultural\nand scientific works to the nation and thus\nhelp its advancement should be honored ac\ncordingly. say these people. In fact, the Royal\nSociety of Canada a few years ago suggested\nthe establishment of a Canadian honor system\nfor such people. Who will pick these loaders,\nasked the public? Will there not be cries \u2018of\nfavoritism when a few have to be picked from\nmany for such honors? And while the Royal\nSociety's idea was dropped, there have been\nadvocates since of granting titles tinder some\nsuch commission as that functioning tat Eng\nland during the reign of the Labor government.\nMany wno are in ravor or tne restoration oi\ntitles state definitely that they do not want\nto see politicans being granted titles, but rather\nthose who have accomplished something in\nscience, literature and art. Despite this assur\nance, the opposition remains strong, because\nIt is felt that once titles can again be conferred\non Canadians, the present absence of a host of\ntitled members of Parliament, cabinet ministers,\nSenators, judges, lieutenant governors and all\nthe other officials will soon be rectified with\na wholesale handing out of sirs.\nAnd this brings up another opposition paint.\nThose against the restoration of titles say that\nif they were handed out In great profundity,\ntitles would soon cease to mean anything and\nso they would eventually be banned altogether.\nWomenfolk are considered one of the real\nreasons behind the title restoration fight. While\nmale vanity might desire a title, it is suggested\nby the opposition that it is really the wives who\nwould like to have a lady before their name.\nIn the social whirl such a prefix means a great\ndeal.\nTHE outbursts for the restoration come mostly\nfrom Quebec and Ontario. This is natural.\nQuebec, while strongly liberal, cannot forget the\nseigneurial days under the French regime. |n\nOntario one of the earliest governors, SlmcoT\nwho founded Toronto in 1795, was all in favor\nof forming a landed aristocracy. In fact, he\neven attempted it and failed.\nMost or the sirs in the Dominion win be\nunable to pass the title on to their sons. They\nare knights bachelor and represent every phase\nof the Dominion\u2019s life, among them being\nfinanciers, educators, judges, industrialists and\nlawyers. There are a few baronets who will\nbe able to pass their titles on to their sons\nor daughters. Then there are the six peers,\nthree of whom reside in Canada and three in\nEngland. The oldest peerage title la the\nDominion is that of the Earl of Aylmer, which\nwas created in the seventeenth century to a\nnaval officer for services to his country. Foe\nmany generations the Earls of Aylmer have\nbeen living in the Dominion, the ninth baron\nnow living in British Columbia.\nThe only French-Canada title remaining is\nthat of the Seigneury of Longueuil, created by\nLouis XIV of France in 1700. Tfee eighth\nBaron of Longueuil recently died in France,\nnever having lived in Canada, and the present\nbolder of the title is John de Bienville Charles\nGrant, who lives in England.\ni-ora Atholstan is the first holder of that\ntitle, and he is a newspaper proprietor who\nworked his way from reporter to the owner\nship of the Montreal Star. He lives ia Moot\nreal, where also lives Baron Shaughnessy,\nthe second of the line, whose family is tied\nup with the Canadian Pacific Railway. Anoth- ,\ner of Canada\u2019s peers who are entitled to aeMfr\nin the House of Lords in England Is Lord\nStrathcona, the second baron bearing that\nname, who lives in England and whose father\nwas a famous Canadian pioneer and states\nman. The other Canadian peer is Lord Bea\nverbrook, the great English newspaper pub\nlisher, who used to be Max Aiken and then\nSir Max Aiken.\nXxud Greenwood, who was recently raised\nto the peerage from Sir Hamar Greenwood,\nis another Canadian who resides in the United\nKingdom, where he has become a well-known\nstatesman.\n(Coprrisbt. lttt.)", "batch": "dlc_1arp_ver01", "title_normal": "evening star.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1932-03-13/ed-1/seq-83.json", "place": ["District of Columbia--Washington"], "page": "13"}, {"sequence": 124, "county": [null], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83045462/1951-08-05/ed-1/seq-124/", "subject": ["Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505", "Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Washington"], "date": "19510805", "title": "Evening star.

To any one\nwho has followed the progressive devel\nopment of the relations of dominion and\nprovinces in Canada this just about caps\nthe climax of the economic separation\nwhich is threatening the life of the\nDominion.\nIn other words, Canada appears to be\n\"Balkanizing\" itself. It is threatening to\nturn\u2014it is almost visibly turning\u2014from\nwhat was meant to be a united nation\ninto a confederate group of autonomous\nunits. It is reproducing in itself the dis\nruption of the British Empire three gen\nerations ago under the name of \"re\nsponsible government.\" The economic\nresources of the British Empire are now\nso hopelessly divided that no single au\nthority can make use of them. Those of\nCanada are going the same way.\nThe federal union of British North\nAmerica into the Dominion of Canada\nwas brought about in the years 1864-67\nunder the sharp stimulus of a war scare.\nThe general intention was to join the\nprovinces under a real central govern\nment. There was to be no dual sov\nereignty, no state's rights, no secession.\nThe spectacle of the United States, torn\nwith the Civil War, served as an example\nof the results of divided authority.\nProvince of Alberta is present\ning a claim against the Do\nminion of Canada for the\nreimbursement of 25 years'\nDUT a real union was difficult, almost\nimpossible. The vast stretches of the\nwilderness called British North America,\nbroken here and there with settlements\nand seaports, had scarcely any connec\ntions with one another.\nHere on the Atlantic seaboard were the\nmaritime provinces. They had no\nthought of union with Canada, upper\nand lower. They had a life of their own.\nThey looked across the sea to England\nand down the coast to New England\u2014\u25a0\nnever west. Their allegiance was British,\ntheir market was American and their in\ntellectual center was Boston. With Can\nada, even in the season of navigation,\nthey had hardly any. economic contact;\nin Winter none at all.\nOf the two Canadas, French or lower\nCanada was and is like nothing else in\nthe world. It was not even homogeneous\nin itself. It included in Montreal half\na city full of undigested Scotsmen\u2014\nmoney-getters, empire builders\u2014with a\nbackground of cemeteries, priests' farms\nand stone-walled river seigneuries. It\nshared its bed\u2014the bed of the St. Law\nrence\u2014with upper Canada, a totally\ndifferent place. The wedge of land be\ntween the lower lakes had been founded\nby \"Loyalists\"\u2014that is to say, Americans\nfrom Massachusetts and Virginia. It\nhad been fed by British immigration. It\nused Yankee schoolbooks, the New York\nshilling and Thanksgiving turkeys, but\nif you came near it. it waved the Union\nJack at you. Both Canadas were cut off,\nnorth and west, by the illimitable wilder\nness. mostly unexplored. In Winter ac\ncess to the outside world was only\nthrough the United States. There was no\nrailroad, no road even, to the sea.\nHundreds of miles to the west, beyond\nLake Superior, the wilderness changed to\nthe prairie of the northwest, and then\nwent upward and onward to the infinite\ndesolation of the Arctic. Few white\npeople had ever seen it. The northwest\nwas under the Hudson's Bay Co., soverign\nexcept for allegiance to the Oueen.

They\nwent in and out by Hudson Strait and\nNorway House. Canada never saw most\nof them. In all, they numbered round\nthe forts a few hundred whites. With\nthem on the plains and in the woods were\na few French half-breeds and some\n30,000 Indians. Outside the forts the lan\nguage was French or Cree. Only on the\nRed River was there a \"settlement.\"\nThen came the Rocky Mountains, the\nvery symbol of titanic isolation; beyond\ntheir uncounted peaks and gorges was\nthe Pacific Coast. A little colony dozed\nat Victoria; a few diggers scratched for\ngold. In a country nearly twice as large\nas the new German Empire of 1870\nthere were 11,000 white people and about\n35,000 Mongolian Indians. Beyond was\nthe Pacific Ocean.\n\"TO \"FEDERATE\" all this might seem\nimpossible. But the British govern\nment forced the plan through. It bought\nout the Hudson's Bay Co.'s overlordship\nfor $1,500,000 and gave the northwest as\na present to Canada. It guaranteed a\nrailway to the sea. The maritime prov\ninces, resisting and protesting, were\ndragged into the union\u2014New Brunswick\nby a popular election on a momentary\nwave of indignation over the Fenian\nraids; Nova Scotia by a vote of the Leg\nislature against the people's will. Prince\nEdward Island a little later, in 1873, was\nbribed in by the purchase of its bankrupt\nrailway. Newfoundland stayed out.\nThe act of 1867 that made the union\nwas all for central strength. The prov\ninces had only the power expressly given\nthem: the Dominion had all the rest. It\nhad, in addition, the right to nullify pro\nvincial legislation if contrary to the gen\neral interest, of which the federal gov\nernment itself was the judge. It was\nsovereign if it wished to be so. There\nwas no bill of rights, no reservation The\nonly special safeguards for the provinces\nreferred to the language and religion of\nthe French and to the actual areas of the\nprovinces. Economic rights were not con\ncerned. At first sight, the Dominion\nseemed to have them all.\nThe Dominion's ownership of the vast\nnorthwest (less only the little \"postage\nstamp\" Province of Manitoba \u00ef made it\nsupreme for land settlement, home\nsteads, immigration and the building of\nthe transcontinental railway. It held in\nits hands the whole forward movement\nof the Dominion. Its power of taxation\nwas not restricted, but as plenary as\nwords could make it\u2014\"taxation by any\nmode or system.\" The commerce clause\nwas the same.\nThe Dominion controlled money, legal\ntender banks, the customs, the excise. Its\nfinancial power seemed so great that\nthere was little left for the provinces.\nThey had to be put on a dole and re\nceived most of their revenue as a subsidy.\nThe Dominion had the criminal law, a\nconspicuous success from the first. In\nCanada there is only one kind of murder,\nand people get hanged for it. They\ndon't have to be extradited.\nTHE provincial powers looked puny be\nside those of the Dominion. They\ncontrolled \"property\"\u2014that didn't seem\nto mean much\u2014\"direct taxation for a\nprovincial revenue\" meaning in those\n\\iays taxes on land, buildings and such.\nThey controlled \"licenses,\" meaning such\nthings as liquor and peddlers and dogs.\nAt first all the prestige was with the\nDominion. The leading men of the coun\ntry\u2014English and French, east and west\u2014\nsought its offices and the titled honors\nit bestowed. The Macdonalds and the\nTuppers a-nd Cartiers left the provincial\nfield. Wilfred Laurier never entered it.\nThe provinces were left to second-rate\nmen and village politics.\nAt Ottawa was a vice regal court with\nthe princess royal to grace it, and be\nyond that the honors of London and the\ncountenance of the Queen. Beside all\nthat the little old red brick \"legislative\nassembly\" in King street, Toronto, looked\nlike a high school.\nWho could have foreseen the change?\nIn the United States exactly the opposite\nhappened. The Federal Government be\ngan with nothing. By interpretation and\nforce of circumstances it acquired every\nthing. It is now, for weal or woe. the\nauthor and instrument of national sal\nvation.\nNot so in Canada. The economic de\nvelopment since 1867 shifted the center\nof life to the provinces. The rise and\ngrowth of the vast paper industry threw\ninto high relief the importance of the\neastern forests and crown timber lands,\nall controlled by the provinces. It is\nQuebec and Ontario\u2014King Taschereau\nand Prince Hepburn\u2014who are now dic\ntating terms to a vanquished America.\nCanada is rich beyond all the world\nin potential electric power, the main\nmomentum of the world's work when\ngasoline, a vanishing asset, backfires into\nspace. Of the 33,617,000 horsepower esti\nmated, only 731,000 is in territory (Arctic)\ncontrolled by the Dominion. The rest\nbelongs to the provinces.

Tourism received heavy coverage. The St. Johns & Halifax River Railway, later renamed the Florida East Coast Railway, arrived in Daytona in 1886, a decade after the city had been incorporated. With the railway's arrival, Daytona's proximity to the ocean made it a tourist destination. Readers read about the Daytona Speedway attracting fans, rousing stories of moon shining, and coverage of seaside activities in the Sunshine State. During this time, particularly in this place, America started going into water and not just walking along the shore. The Daytona Daily News began publishing in 1903. In 1927, following the 1926 merger of the Florida cities of Daytona, Daytona Beach and Seabreeze into the new city of Daytona Beach, the newspaper changed its name to the Daytona Beach News [LCCN: sn96027149]. But the new name was short-lived. Later in 1927, the newspaper merged with the Daytona Beach (FL) Journal [LCCN sn96027151]. In 1936, the new newspaper split into the Daytona Beach (FL) Evening News [LCCN sn96027153] and the Daytona Beach (FL) Morning Journal [LCCN sn93063708]. The newspaper, then under the title, the Daytona Beach News-Journal was acquired by the Davidson family in 1928. Herbert M. Davidson edited the newspaper from 1928 to his death in 1985, a longer than usual tenure, even for a family-owned newspaper. His father, Julius Davidson, the first president and general manager of the paper, enjoyed a reputation for outstanding community service and civic involvement. --E.

The land that will yet be the home of\nmillions, that will raise the wheat and produce the meat that will feed other millions\non the other side of the world is at last awake\nAll at once western Canada has thrown off its lethargy, has sprung into a new\nlife of which it is fully conscious and others, too. All at once people everywhere\nin America seem suddenly to have realized that western Canada has a healthful and\nnot unpleasant climate, that its plains are fertile, that it is well-adapted to settle-\nment, and that thousands are pressing in to settle it. All at once there has begun\nto flow into western Canada a steady stream of emigration from the United States,\nlargely made up of that typical American element which always wants to move into\nthe new country just beyond. It is no reflection on the lands they leave behind that\nthousands of American farmers are now pressing into Manitoba, Alberta, Assimboia\nand Saskatchewan. It is only a manifestation, now in a land over which the stars\nand stripes do not fly, of the racial impulse to move on westward and northward,\nto take new, wild land, to build new homes, to carve fortunes out of the wilderness,\nto win the west.\nTHE AMER1C\\N INVADERS CROSS THE L1\nIn tbe United States the wave of migration has hurled itself against the Rocky\nmountains, has passed over it to the fertile valleys of the Pacific coast, has turned\nback Into good regions long neglected, is occupying the forest lands so long ignored\nIn favor of the praries and, while there is yet a vast amount of good cheap land in\nthe northwest of the United States which is now being occupied by a much larger\nimmigration than that western Canada is enjoying, the indisputable fact is that the\nAmerican pioneer has at last made bold to cross the forty-ninth parallelobnoxious\n\\'ne to him, for he earnestly wishes that all North America were but ono nation. But\nhe has looked across that line and has seen the good land and he has possessed him-\nself of it. It was not in him to let the fat prairies of Manitoba and Assiniboia, the\nbeautiful valleys of Alberta and Saskay.ewan inviting men to come in and take\npossession and not be among the first to accept the invitation. So the recorded\nimmigration of Americans into Canada has bounded up from nothing four years ago\nto 18,000 last year, and perhaps 50,000 this.\nE COtEPTIO OK WESTERN CAN VDA\nAll notions die hard, old teachings are difficult to eradicate, but he who would\nknow the truth should resolve to realize that in Saskatchewan, Assiniboia and Al-\nberta, not to say anything of Manitoba, there are 150,000,000 acres of good land open\nto settlement either by purchase or homestead. He must also realize that the\nclimate is no great handicap. In Manitoba and eastern Assiniboia the winter may\n'begin a trifle earlier, last a bit longer and be somewhat colder than in the latitude\nof Minneapolis and the mean annual temperature is down pretty low but it is neverthe-\nless a climate peculiarly favorable to grain growing. The summer's mean tempera-\nture is about the same as that of New York and the isotherm of New York at that\nperiod of the year reaches clear to the far Peace river. Moreover the summer days\nIn this far northern latitude are long and plant life gets the indispensable sunshine\nfor many more hours each day than in regions that have on the whole a much milder\nclimate. It must be realized also that though the rainfall is light in parts of this\n\\ast area methods of cultivation that conform to that fact have been developed wih\nsuch success that the lack of rain is no longer a handicap. Thus it conies about that\nthere is now a rush for lands in regions which were a few years ago deemed unfit for\ncultivation.\nTheodore Myers, an Iowa banker, who has bought largely of Canadian lands for\nyears gives it as the opinion of a man who has dealt in lands for years that that\nportion of Assiniboia which lies between the international boundary on the south,\nthe Soo line on the west, the main line of the Canadian Pacific on the north and\nManitoba on the east, is the finest agricultural region in the world Yet it is only\nivithin three or four years tnat this region has really been appreciated.\nTHE UltOWIXi STEEL HIGHWA\\S\nThe era of intense activity upon which western Canada is just entering, an era\nwhich will introduce the strenuous life north of the forty-ninth parallel, is well\nIllustrated by railroad activity. From Erwood on the eastern iedge of Saskatchewan\nthe Canadian Northern is pushing on to Edmonton through 500 miles of rich country,\n\"the Great Fertile Belt of the Saskatchewan\" and within Ave years its trains will\nroll through the Yellow Head pass beyond and descend to the Pacific coast, giving\nCanada its second transcontinental line Then will come the building of northward\nbranches into Athabasca. Meantime the Canadian Pacific with northward stretch-\ning lines already built to Prince Albert in Saskatchewan and Edmonton in northern\nAlberta is throwing out a new line from Yorkton in eastern Saskatchewan, which\nwill be extended to Prince Albert and probably on to Edmonton, too, while still\nanother line will creep north from Moosomin on the main line and the Pipestone\nbranch will be extended from Areola northwest to Regina Truly the railways are\nlaying the foundation of empire These new lines open up a new country, which,\nnotwithstanding its high latitude is still south of the latitude of St. Petersburg and in\nthe western part especially enjoys a comparatively mild climate.\nGATHERING IN THE SETTLERS\nThe railways are co-operating with the general and local governments and the\ngreat land holding companies to pour population into these vast regions. The Domin-\nion immigration service has extended its machinery into many of the American states\nand into all the countries^ of western Europe. Agents in the states receive certain\nfees for every settler they secure, literature is distributed broadcast, lecturers travel\nthrough the country. Similar methods are invoked in Great Britain where Canadian\nadvertising matter is believed to have been put into the hands of every farmer and\nfarm laborer In England, with results that are now seen in crowded emigrant ships\npushing in procession up the St. Lawrence to discharge their human freights into\ntrains that will whirl them across the continent.\nThe old country settlers go in for homesteads, while the Americans prefer, as a\nrule, to buy. At first, at least, the Americans are not inclined to give up their\nAmerican citizenship which Is necessary to secure a homestead title.\nAt last Canada begins to feel that thrilling population movement which has been\nfelt on the American frontier for a hundred years. The lands that have long waited\nfor cultivation shall wait no longer. Henceforth the population of Manitoba, Assini-\nboia, Alberta and Saskatchewan will increase with leaps and bounds after a fashion\nquite unknown in Canada, but common enough in the United States.\nAN AMERICAN IiMNDATION\nThere is every reason to believe that the American immigration, already the\ngreatest single factor, will soon, so far outstrip that from all other regions that the\nnative Canadian population of western Canada will, within ten years, be submerged\nby peaceful American invasion. \"The hour of Canada's destiny has struck,\" and\nas usual, the Americans are In on the ground floor.\nNORTHERN FLIGHT OF THE FARMER BIRD.\nThere are 60,000,000*acres of arable land in Manitoba and Assiniboia\nalone.\nThese lands will easily support a population of 6,000,000* There are\nnow on them 320,000 people. *\nThe number of immigrants officially recorded as entering Western\nCanada last year was 44,000 of whom 18,000 were Americans. The real\ntotal was somewhat larger.\nThat explains why the Canadian Pacific has recently raised the price on\nmuch of its land from $3 to $5, while in two y ears many private holdings\nhave gone up from $5 and $10 to $15 an acre.\nThe enormous grain crop of last year, which was a graphic demonstra-\ntion of the possibilities of the country, had much to do, also, with the\nincrease im land values.\nThe present era of cheap land can not last long. Even $50 per acre has\nalready been offered for choice lands in southern Manitoba.\nThis land is, certainly the equal in producing power of any wild land in\nthe world.\nIt is believed that in many places, so deep is the soil and the equally\nfertile subsoil, that the fertility is practically inexhaustible.\nMany far-sighted Americans have already purchased immense tracts\nand are buying all they can.\nLand sales this year are three to four times what they were last year.\nThe railroads are planning extensions totaling thousands of miles. 7hey\nare working night and day increasing their equipment.\nThree-fourths of the hard wheat area lies north of the 49th parallel.\nIndian Head Experiment Farm.\n__________ -\nIV? _= _ m itr sinih nii^ | TUU Is One View of a Farm That Una Been a Potent Agency In Demonstrating the Agricultural Value of\nWestern Canada. -'\ns' '\n, J_ ^,:v' S s * WSB&to&RJi&t&\n^ . ^ I I _ - i, ^ ,i 1^,1.,!! j i g , n i/m m - . - ^ i , - MI i.n-_f-,lpili ,nrriHL' \" 'I1\nsr.\n%\nBUMPER CROPS OF 1901\nMADE WESTERN CANADA\n* ^*_\nThey Have Struck the Hour of Destiny for a Countryfof^i\nVast Area and of Untold Agricultural\nPotentialities.\nThe Cry for Help in the Fields and the Railroad Conges\ntion Have Graphically Advertised\n:\nthe Country.\nThe Highest Average Wheat Yield Ever Obtained From\nSo Large an AcreageThe Finest\nHard Wheat.\nTwenty-five bushels of wheat per acre, the average for Manitoba, Assiniboia,\nSaskatchewan and Alberta lor 1901, made western Canada. - More than that, it\nopened the gates of opportunity and development to the entire dominion.\nWestern Canada has long been on the map. Since its wonderful performance\nlast year in raising 63,425,428 bushels of wheat from 2,520,399 acres of soil, it has been,\nin the minds of thousands of farmers seeking to better their condition. Practical\neconomists have prophesied for years that some day the plains of western Canada\nwould be the big granary of the continent. The wonderful yield of grain in 1901\nstarted the invading hosts of American farmers toward the new field of enterprise\nand industry to prove that these prophetic visions were not idle dreams.\nABUNDANT YIELDS OF A BUMPER TEAR\nForty bushels of barley, forty-eight of oats, and twenty-five of wheat per acre J\nis an average yield that will draw to any country the attention of the thrifty.

Everything the farmer planted yielded\nabundantly. For ten years this same soil has to its credit an average yield of 19.92\nbushels of wheat. With the exception of 1900 when crop conditions in the west were\ngenerally disappointing, western Canada has given abundant and profitable yields of\ngrain. While some of the most fertile sections of the west recorded (failures for\nthat year Manitoba yielded an average of ten bushels of wheat per acre. In 1899\nand 1898 its average was over seventeen bushels in 1897 and 1896 it exceeded four-\nteen bushels, and its yield in 1895 was nearly twenty-eight bushels per acre.\nA SURPRISE TO THE CANADIANS\nCanadians themselves participated largely in the surprise party last year. When\nPremier Roblin and others estimated the probable yield of Manitoba at 50,000,000\nbushels there were plenty of people in Canada as well as outside too surprised to\naccept such figures. Western Canada had been developing gradually. The increase\nin population had come by such easy stages as to create little comment. The in-\ncrease in grain acreage had come without prediction or comment. The productive-\nness of the soil was appreciated, but when with the increase in acreage and the\npromised bumper yield was upon her people with its consequent demands in machinery\nand labor, western Canada was as greatly surprised at the results of her work as\nwere thousands of her cities on this side of the line. Western Canada had the '\nmost strenuous experience in her history in harvesting and housing the 1901 crop.\nMen were brought from the east by trainloads and thousands and machinery and ma-\nterial poured Into the grain districts as fast as they could be secured.\nBEST QUALITY OF HARD WHEAT\nCanadian hard wheat is of the best quality produced in the worlds In addition\nto raising a bumper crop, western Canada produced a high quality of every kind of\ngrain. The question of warehousing and transportation lowered the price to some\nextent this year. The bumper crop caught the Canadian elevator companies and\nrailroads by surprise. American millers and grain men are ready to assist in\nhandling Canadian wheat so as to prevent it being dumped on the market at a sacri-\nfice. All that is necessary is the removal of the useless duty. When American\ngrain facilities can be used in the handling of the Canadian crop, the Canadian pro-\nducer will realize every cent of the value of his products in the world's markets.\nCanadian hard wheat has already established a reputation for high quality. All\nthat remains is to perfect the work of putting it on the market to advantage.\nOTHER CROPS THAN WHEAT\nBut wheat is not the whole story. Manitoba devoted 940,000 acres to coarse\ngrains last year and 34,600 acres to roots and potatoes. The same proportion of the\nacreage in other parts of western Canada was seeded to these products. The thresh-\ning machine told a big story in oats. Forty bushels to the acre and quality the best. -\nFor eighteen years western Canada has an average yield of oats to her credit of thir-\nty-four bushels je acre. There have been seasons where, some sections produced\n100 bushels to the acre. At Brandon in 1899 the yield reached an average of 120\nbushels.\nBarley averaged 34.2 bushels per acre in western Canada last year. The long\ndays of bright sunshine which that country enjoys during the barley harvest, gives\nCanadian barley an advantage. Over 200,000 acres were devoted to this grain last\nyear. The yield was not an unusual one for western, Canada. It was simply a con- ,\ntinuation of a good record.\nFlax, rye and peas figured lightly in last year's results. Flax will rapidly become '\na favorite crop in Manitoba but so ifar its culture has been confined to a small\narea. Peas yielded well fast year wherever sown and the western Canada farmer\nhas reaWzed so well on this portion of his crop that the acreage is sure to increase.\nWestern Canada demonstrated last year that its broad acres were capable of\nsupplying the continent with potatoes. The Canadian tubers were remarkable for\ntheir size and the big yield per acre. The average yield of all kinds of field roots'\nincluding potatoes, turnips, carrots, beets, etc., was in the neighborhood of 300\nbushels per acre. * . '^\nLAND VALUES MUST INCREASE- * ' . -' \"O\nIt is such demonstrations as that in western Canada last year which is evening s\nup the big difference in price between western lands and those of some sections of\nthe east. On the theory that property is worth what it will earn, the f\nfertile soil of western Canada is increasing in value rapidly, while the high priced.\nlands of some parts of the east requiring the use of fertilizer are decreasing in value.\nThe American farmer wants results. Canada produced the figures last year and will,\ndo It again. Not only is she to become the great grain producing region but her1\nfarmers have every facility for increasing* her output of dairy products with much\nprofit to themselves. To the American now there are \\wo stars of empire. One is\nmoving north. Bumper crops in Canada are changing the map of the continent.\nThey will increase its highways of steel, furnish new possibilities for the milling In-\ndustry, and multiply the fleets that carry the staff of life from Lake Superior ports to\neastern terminals. Canada's bumper crop has completed the awakening of the west.\nsi^\n& . -X w- \\& iv_d___k^\n^ _ _ _ _ _ ! . . _t D*a#t_h IZZI\nTii_wwi_ii_gmiiahti |i^iinjji_", "batch": "mnhi_amboy_ver02", "title_normal": "minneapolis journal.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045366/1902-04-15/ed-1/seq-17.json", "place": ["Minnesota--Hennepin--Minneapolis"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 11, "county": ["Mahoning", "Allegheny", "Allegheny"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Weekly (except the second week in July and the week after Thanksgiving)", "id": "/lccn/sn84024547/1959-03-18/ed-1/seq-11/", "subject": ["Allegheny County (Pa.)--Newspapers.", "Croatian Americans--Pennsylvania--Allegheny--Newspapers.", "Croatian Americans.--fast--(OCoLC)fst00883782", "Croats--United States--Newspapers.", "Croats.--fast--(OCoLC)fst00883833", "Mahoning County (Ohio)--Newspapers.", "North Side (Pittsburgh, Pa.)--Newspapers.", "Ohio--Mahoning County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01207166", "Ohio--Youngstown.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01213545", "Pennsylvania--Allegheny County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01209250", "Pennsylvania--Pittsburgh--North Side.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01322947", "Pennsylvania--Pittsburgh.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01205171", "Pittsburgh (Pa.)--Newspapers.", "United States.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204155", "Youngstown (Ohio)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Youngstown", "Allegheny", "Pittsburgh"], "date": "19590318", "title": "Zajednic\u030car = Fraternalist.

This\nrule declares the batter to be out\nwhenever he puts up a fly ball that\ncan be handled by an infielder, with\nthe first and second occupied, pro\nvided there are not two men out at\nthe time. This does not apply to a\nline hit, but to any high fly which an\ninfielder can get under. The rule\ndoes not apply if only first base is oc\ncupied. There must be runners on\nboth first and second and less than\ntwo out. This age in adopted a num\nber of years ago in order to avoid\nthe chance of a cinch double play,\nwhich often came up before this rule\nwas put in force. With men on first\nand second and only one or none out,\nif the batter lifted a fly ball to an\ninfielder, said lnfielder, if a foxy play\ner, could muff or trap the ball, failing\nto catch it on the fly. Of course, in\nthat case the runners would be forced\nto advance, and the fielder, if a smart\nplayer, could force two of them out\nand thus get a double play, which\ncould not be prevented In any way by\nthe batting side. Of course, if only\nfirst base was occupied he would not\nget a double play on the fly ball, for\nthe batter could always beat it to\nfirst if he ran it out, but with first and\nsecond both occupied it was a cinch\nLEW1STOWN\nMONDAY, JULY\nFree Circus Street Parade 10:30 a. m.\n9 bands, 250 horses, \u25a0!\u00a3&\npeople of all climes in native costumes will be shown in parade.\nTwo shows daily\u2014afternoon at 2, night at 8, doors open at 1\nand 7 p.m. Waterproof tents.

It does not make any dif\nference then whether the ball is\ncaught or not so far as the batter is\nI concerned. He is out anyway, and\nj the base runners are not forced to ad\nvance, but may hold their bases. This\ndeclaring of the batter out on such a\nfly prevents a double play of a cinch\nvariety.

If it is caught\nby one of the lnfielders it is the same\nas any fly ball ad they must hold their\nbases until the catch has been made.\nBut if it is muffed or allowed to fall\nto the ground without being touched,\nthe base runners do not have to re\ntouch their bases and may continue\nto the next bases, if they can make\ntheir way there without being touched\nwith the ball. This Is a point which\nhas caused quite a good deal of argu\nment. Some have claimed that the\nrunners had to remain on their bases\nuntil the ball was either caught or\nmuffed or allowed to hit the ground.\nPresident Lynch of the National\nleague, however, has decided that this\nis not the case. If the ball is caught\nthe players must hold their bases the\nsame as on any other fly ball. But if\nit is not caught, they do not have to\ngo back and touch their bases and\ncan go as far forward as they are able\nto. This is a good thing for young\nplayers to remember and they may\nget a chance to take advantage of it\nbefore the season is over.\nPittsburg Chronicle-Telegraph: The\nargument as to which is the greatest\npitcher, Mathewson or Walter John\nson, is like a dispute as to which ia\nthe most effective\u2014a sharp rapier in\nthe hands of a skilful swordsman or\na brickbat in the hands of a brick\nbat-shooting expert. At that, one\nmust give the great pitcher of the\nNationals credit for more than his\nmarvelous speed. In most cases that\nis enough, but just the other day the\nstory came over the wire of how he\nhad changed one of his pitching pe\nculiarities. He used to sneak the first\nball over the plate with nothing on it\nbut speed. The batters began to hit\nthe first pitch. Now he is putting\neverything he has on that first de\nlivery. Johnson physically is the best\nequipped pitcher in any league, but\neven he has to use craft at times.\nNew York Press: \"Recently a man\ndied playing golf,\" says Tom Magili\ngan, who further opines: \"That is a\nvery appropriate thing to do while\nplaying that game.\"\nEvery one of the eastern teams has\ncome and gone and the Athletics\nlooked the class of the eastern teams\nin the American league, says Bill Bar\nley. The Boston Red Sox may outhit\nthem. It wouldn't be a bit surprising\nif they did that on the season. And\nthey may even look the stronger ball\nclub when Joe Wood is on the mound.\nJust as the Washington Senators may\nlook the more formidable when\nWalter Johnson is doing the pitching.\nBut day in and day out the Athletics\nseem to be the class and appear to\nbe the team the South Siders will\nhave to beat if they win the pennant.\nWe have seen them all in action.\nThe invasion of the west by the teams\nof the east came to a close on Thurs\nday when Lefty Russell outpltched\nBuck O'Brien, even if the Red Sox did\nouthit those who wear the hose of\nwhite and gave the South Siders a 2\nto 1 vtctory.\nThe Athletics looked stronger on\nthe South Side, and this despite the\nfact that the Red Sox formed the only\neastern team that took a series from\nCallahan's men.\nThe greatest difference in the play\nof the Mackmen and the Red Sox lay\nin their method of attack. The fel\nlows who take orders from the elon\ngated Mack seemed to know exactly\nwhat they were up there to do. Every\nplay seemed to be a part of a system.\nOne inning they would go after a\npitcher and hit the first ball pitched.\nThe fact that the first man to try\ndidn't get away witn it didn't make\nany difference. They kept right on.\nThe next inning they would play a\nwaiting game. The attacks seemed to\nbe concentrated, seemed to be a part\nof a general system.\nWith the Red Sox it was different.\nThey hit the ball a whole lot harder\nthan, the Philadelphia lads. But they\ndidn't come anywhere near making\ntheir hitting net the same results.\nThey seemed to hit spasmodically.\nThe impression you got after watch\ning the Athletics in action was that\nthe team was a machine. The impres\nsion you gathered from the play of\nthe Red Sox was that the team was\ncomposed of a bunch of fellows who\ncould hit the ball a mile, but who\ndidn't seem to get anywhere despite\ntheir long drives.\nOf course the Red Sox were handi\ncapped by the absence of Jake Stahl,\nthe manager, and by Gardner, the reg\nular third baseman. The team under\nStahl might have looked a better ma\nchine.\na one-man team during the stay in Chi\ncago. When Speaker was clouting\nwneu opeaaer was clouting,\nthe fellows were getting men about\nthe bases. When Speaker failed then\nthorn nrno J _ I __ * , . \u2022\nthere was nothing doing. And that\nv ^ uuiuxiig uuiug. ana mat\nseems to have been the history of the\nclub on this first western\n\u2022**->=.\nBut it looked a whole lot more like\non this first western invasion.\n\u2014\" UIOI ncaici U invasion.\nThere's no reason to spend a lot of\ntime worrying about the Senators at\nthis stage of the game.

But if the teams of the east\nplay to the form they displayed in\nChicago the Athletics form the aggre\ngation that Janies Callahan will have\nto spend nights planning to defeat,\n-\nThe exact difference between the\nPittsburg club as a rank outsider and\na pennant contender is John Peter\nWagner, sometimes known as Hans.\nThat difference is now on the job.\nAs things turned out, it is possible\nthat the Pirates could have won with\n\u00b0^L\\Y ag \" er ? n , thelr flrst tilt with the\n------- die uuv so given to noil\ndays as is Colonel Ebbets, the his\ntorical sharp of Brooklyn, the open -1\ning event at the Polo grounds could\njustly have been termed a Wagner\nday Honus was in there cutting!\nsuch capers as were cut back in 1897,!\nwhen he first came from Louisville to\nbreak into city life. Remarkable asj\nit may seem to PIttsburgers who con-,\nfine their rooting to home talent, the'\nNew York fans were with John Peter,\nhook, line and sinker. No home hero\never gbt a bigger reception' than did\nWagner when he first went to bat,!\nand when he made that home run in\nto the stand, sinking the shaft of de\nteat deeper, fans stood up and yelled\nwith as much enthusiasm as if Larry\nDoyle had just delivered a pennant-'\nwinning blow. They love Wagner i n\nthis town, and he couldn't kill that af\nfection if he beat us every day. The i\ngreatest man in the game will always I\nbe a hero in New York. ]\nThe venerable John Peter is now!\nclose on to his 40th year, and, saving |\na few rheumatics and a spavin here I\nand there, is the same marvel who\nhas batted for an average of .350 for\n16 years. The only weakness appar\nent to the fan is a slight lack of speed.\nHonus can't tear around the bases and\nannoy pitchers as he did of yore, but,\nbelieve us, he can bust that ball in\nthe nose with the same deadly ac\ncuracy that splintered the whole i\nleague for four campaigns. |\nLest the younger fans forget, it i\nmight be a good idea to tell you some- J\nthing a little history about this won- i\nderful Wagner. John Peter, or Honus,\nas ycju will, came to Pittsburg from\nLouisville in 1897 as an outfielder.;\nThat season he had a batting average\nof 2fi7 T f DP Vin nn 1 L. A _i_ _ m\nof .367. Later he took up the job of\nshortstopping, and has been at it ever\nsince. His batting average for these\n16 years has been in the neighborhood\nof .350. Honus was the champion\nhitter for seven seasons.\n: E)\nOF INTEREST TO\nFARMERS\nHundreds of expatriated Americans\nin the Canadian provinces will come\nback to Montana, if a first-hand knowl\nedge of conditions obtaining in this\nstate are any inducement to them.\nCommissioner J. M. Kennedy, commis\nsioner of the bureau of agriculture\nand publicity, will leave this week to\ntour the provinces of Saskatchewan\nand Alberta, says the Helena Record.\nHundreds of letters he has received\nfrom dissatisfied settlers in those\nprovinces, and to these will be\nbrought information about the Treas\nure state. This tour marks the first\nvigorous effort that has been made by\nan American state to secure immigra\ntion from Canada, and it marks also\nthe adoption of a new plan for secur\ning settlers. Instead of waiting for\nthe settlers to come to Montana to\nlearn of its advantage, this knowl\nedge will be carried to them in their\nown homes.\nFor years the Canadian govern\nment has maintained immigration bu\nreaus in all of the principal cities of\nthe United States,\" said Commission\ner Kennedy today. \"Such bureaus are\nnow being maintained in Great Falls\nand in Butte, at which places attrac\ntive advertising is issued and men\nare stationed to preach the glories of\nCanada. There is no question that\nthis method of advertising has been\nvery effective in stimulating Canadian\nimmigration.\n\"It should be explained, however,\nthat this trip is nothing in the way\nof a retaliatory move, and that the\nbest of feelings are maintained be\ntween the Montana department cf\nagriculture and publicity and the im\nmigration departments of the Cana\ndian provinces. This trip is only in\nresponse to w'hat seems to me to be\na condition of affairs which merits\nthe attention of Montanans. For the\npast five months, this office has been\ndeluged with inquiries from people in\nSaskatchewan and Alberta. It is safe\nto say that at least twenty-five per\ncent, of the people who have written\nthis department for aid in securing\nhomesteads have been from these\ntwo provinces. Many of these in\nquirers have already becbme settlers\non Montana soil, and many more are\ndiscussing the advisability of coming\nhere.\nuun \u2022'-\u25a0sources oi mis stare, ana it\nthis idea that the present 'li\nvas i\u00b0 n of Canada' is undertaken.\"\nlUu L r nnnnJ.. ...

LAUT.\nTHE announccmaii comes with pe\nculiar irony to Canada, that the\nUnited States will presently tako steps to\nhftntllo Liberty Loans after the method\nfollowed by tho Dominion on\" Victory\nLoans; \"for Canada, dauntless Canada,\nwith a record for her heroic fighters that\nhas placed her reputation on a pedestal\nof glory and almost idolatry, is the one\ncountry among all tho Allies whose financ\ning has been made more difficult by Uncle\nSam entering the war.\nBelgium, France, Great Britain, Serbia,\neven China, have been helped financially foot wire fence\" of regulations to keep in-\nGood! But where did that leave Can\nada T Before she could borrow on the\nAmerican market, but now she couldn't.\nAs a matter of fact Canadian securities\nare' still'isent down to big American\nhouses, but they are not sold by the big\nAmerican houses in the American market.\nThey are sent back to be sold by branches\nof those American houses in Canada. It\nneed hardly be guessed they are not all\nsold to Canadians in Canada. 'There are\na lot of rich American corporations in\nCanada and there is a lot of American\ncapital in Canada; and it takes mora than\n\"a horse high, mule strong, pig tight ax\nwith credits and loans by Uncle Sam's\nparticipation. For Canada alono has\nfinancing been made harder; and Canada\nboth in peace and war is one of Uncle\nSam's very best trade customers, both as a\nbuyer and a seller.\n. The countries have never been closer\nmentally and spiritually. When Canadian\ntroops appear on the screens in a movie\noil this side the lino the audience claps its\nhands soro with enthusiasm; and when\nAmcricnn troops passed through Canadian\ncities a few weeks ago they owned the\ntbwns. Canadians literally yelled their\nlieads off with welcome. Yet Canada is\n.the one country with a technical discrimi\nnation against her financially. Thougti\nshe is one of our best customers, exchange\n. has been running against her high as 2\n- ijer cenr.\nExchange \"Pegged\" Elsewhere.\nWe have sent commissioners, official and\nunofficial, to Spain to right exchange,\nwhere the discount was running against\nus; and we have sent commissioners to\nItaly to right exchange, where the rate\nwas ruling against our Italian ally. Wc\nhave \"pegged\" exchange for our big allies\nlike England and wo have even fixed rates\nand stretched tho law to do it for re\nmote lands like India, setting the price of\nsilver, for instance, so speculators could\nnot buy silver cheap and sell it dear to\nIndia; but for the Dominion, which is first\nblood brother to Undo Sam, we have done\nless than nothing. ,\n'Wo have permitted tho war to work an\nutterly unnecessary hardship and handi\ncap financially; and we have done it on a\ntechnicality far les3 essential than the\nregulations we stretched to help India.\n'The situation is about the best example\nthis war has, afforded financially of lr.\nBumble's description of the law as an ais\nand an idiot. Hero in brief is the status:\nSnag the first : Before the United States\nwent into the war Canadian securities,\nmunicipal, provincial and even Federal,\ncould be launched on the American market\nand were bought with greater avidity than\npurely British loans or Anglo-French\nbonds. Look up the list of values for\n1916 if you want to sec just how the\nAmerican public regarded Canadians in\ncomparison to Europeans. Early in the\nwar the Canadian Government raised\nloans in the United States to the value of\nnearly $180,000,000.\nBiLun.';this country entering the war\nthe special issues committee rightly ruled\nagainst foreign securities being sold on\nthe American market Allies could secure\ncredits or straight loans from the Ameri\ncan Treasury. The national guarantee of\nthe Allies stood behind these credits and\nloans and the money for the loans wan\nraised direct from the American public\nby taxes and Liberty bonds, behind which\nagain stood the guarantee of all Uncle\nSam's wealth and power.\nEffect of War Bond Flotation.\nThe arrangement looked copper riveted\nand nickel plated. Nobody could - lose.\nTTdoIc Sam behind tho Liberty bonds.\nThe Allies behind tho loans and credits.\nBonds, loans and credits had practically\nthe wealth and integrity of the allied\nworld behind them. They would be paid.\nThey would never bo repudiated. It\nwasn't like a public boom when privato\ncorporation had issued private securities\nto general investors and when tl.u failure\nof one or two corporations might set all\nthe general investors pitching securities\non the scrap heap in a general panic.\n, : -There i could never-bo n panic in these\n- bonds and loans backed by Governments\nand nations the strongest on earth. By\ntaking national securities out of private\nhands and placing them solely under\nTreasury management nn impregnable,\nbreakwater soenscd' to havo been erected\nagainst panic or collapse. V 11\nvestors seeking good securities from se\ncurities seeking good investors; but tho\nfact is, Canadian eecuritics are ruled off\ntho American market during the war.\nCanada technically is of the British\nEmpire. Canada geographically and\nfinancially is first blood brother to Uncle\nSam. To the British Empire our Treas\nury can extend credits and loans as one\nof the allies; but what Canada wonts as\nto credits and loans she must get through\nEngland.\nNow England at the present moment is\npractically borrowing from Canada. To\nbo meticulously accurate, England is buy\ning enormous aggregates of war supplies\nfrom Canada on long time credits. In\n1917-18 she bought $800,000,000 of goods\nfrom Canada and sold back only $80,\n000,000 worth; but England is not parting\nwith any coin to liquidate those credits\njust now. She is keeping all her coin in\ntho realm against the day of settlement\nafter tho war. Sho is now financing tho\narmies Canada sends across; but she. is\nnot paying cash for her war purchases.\nMeanwhile Canada is buying enor\nmously in the United States for 1917\nsho bought $790,000,000 ; and though she\nis one of the biggest sellers to the United\nStates, her sales here totalled only $440,\n000,000. To settle the difference of-$350,-000,000,\nshe had what T Abundant cred\nits in England, yes but those credits\ndon't pay Canada's bills; and discount has\nbeen running against her 2 per cent.\nGoing to Affect All Hanslsi\nAnd Canada's ox is not the only one\ngored. As one of tho very biggest bank\ners in Wall Street, or in the world for that\nmatter, said, \"We are really biting off our\nnose to spitoKHlr face on a purely foolish\ntechnicality. The state of affairs is really\ngoing to hurt ns as much as it does Can\nada, for if a Canadian buyer has to pay\n$1.02 for every $1 worth he buys here,\nor $1,020 for every $1,000 he buys here,\nho is either going to tax the consumer the\ndifference and so decrease the sale of our\ngoods or elso he is going to buy propor\ntionately los to mako up the difference in\nexchange. Either way it is bad for us.\nCanada is one of our best customers in\nthe world. Per capita of her population\nsho is our biggest buyer in the world, and\nas her population increases she is going to\nbe a bigger and bigger buyer. She is to\nday one of the biggest sellers to us; per\ncapita for her population, the biggest\nseller\n\"But that is not the worst of the colossal\nstupidity of this technicality keeping Can\nada from financing in the United States.\nIt is going to hurt us harder right in our\nacute pocket nerve, and I wish every firm\nthat makes big sales to or through Canada\nwould take it up with our Treasury De\npartment. I'll put it in general terms\nfirst. Heretofore when Canadian banks\nhad big surpluses instead of transferring\nthem to European markets to earn interest\nthere fhey sent them down to our banks\nhere. Those surpluses helped us. Wc\nneeded them and could use them both to\nCanada Vadvantage and to ours.\n\"Now if the war goes on, or even after\nthe war, surplus funds are going to bo\nvery' good tilings to havo in reserve. Say\nwhen England begins to pay those credits\nto Canada. If we on a stupid technicality\ndiscriminate' against Canada now, we\naren't going to get those surplus funds on\ndeposit hero, i Wc are going to force Can\nada's surplus funds to European maikets.\nThat will hurt us as much as we do Can\nada. 1\n\"Let. me explain in specific terms what\nI mean and how it will work. In normal\ntimes we may raise, twice as much wheat\nin the aggregate ns Canada, say 700,000,\n000 or 800,000,000 bushels, compared to\nher 350,000,000 bushels; but we are a big\npopulation and consume an enormous\nproportion of our own wheat, easily\n000,000,000 bushels; nnd Canada has s\nsmall population and consumes, say, only\n50,000,000 of her own crop.\nWheat to Afford Great Surplus.\n\"When the war is over and Canada gels\nin her real wheat stride she will easily\nproduce half as much \"wheat as we do,\nsay 400,000,000 bushels. And under nor\nmal conditions Canada will have n bigger\nsurplus to export than wc have; for our\npopulation has grown so much faster than\nour production that up to the time of the\nwar our surplus was u shrinking total.\nAnd under normal conditions much\nCanadian wheat has gone out and must\nalways go out via American ports either\nas flour or grain. The drafts nnd ac\nceptances against foreign firms for this\nwheat passed through our banks and\nhelped to create the very surplus of\nwhich I havo told you; but will they pass\nthrough our hands if wo force Canadian\nfinancing from our banks 1\n\"I am for treating Canada, purely\nfrom selfish motives, exactly as wo treat\nTexas or California. The remedy, of\ncourse, would bo for England to assign\nsome of the loans and credits wc give her\nto our account or balance against Cunada.\nShe might as well pay her debt to Can\nada in that way.\"\nOne of the big Wall Street houses that\nformerly financed many of Canada's\nwheat exports to Hamburg gave precisely\nthe same views. It considered that Amer\nican ports might lose much of Canada's\nreexport trade by aiiy discrimination\nagainst Canadian fiuance just at present.\nNow consider what kind of n cus\ntomer Canada is in trade markets! She\nhas n population not so large as New\nYork State, between 7,000,000 and 8,000,\n000. In 19T4 her foreign trade was over\na billion. Then came the burdens of war.\nIn four years her 7,000,000 or 8,000,000\npcoplo sent to the war a third as many\nsoldiers as the United States' 300,000,000\nhave sent. That is, if Uncle Sam sends\nas many fighters across in proportion to\nhis population ho will place 7,000,000\nfighting men on the firing line.\nYet in the jKriod when that burden fell\non Canada, her foreign trade increased to\ntwo billions and n half. Her exports in\ncreased 250 per cent. Her savings de\nposits increased from $80 per head to\n$120 per head, which explains why her\npeople have been able to finance the war.\nIn fact, for purely war spendings, Cana\ndians havo loaned to their Government\nEasy Going, for This Horse in Old Buggy\nIN front of nn uptown' restaurant stood\na horse and buggy. It was n top\nbuggy, nnd the horse was well kept\nnnd comfortablo looking, j almost ..portly.\nAround -the rim of the buggy's off front\nwheel, between two spokes, was carried\na chain that was made fast to the\" buggy's\nbody.\nPresently out of the house in front\nof which this outfit stood appeared a\nman who walked with calm deliberation\nacross tho sidewalk and unhooked that\nchain and tossed it into\" the buggy. Then\nhe stepped in himself, and seating himself\nnnd gathering1 up tho lines looked out\nacross the horse's bock and said calmly:\n\"Comu up.\" '\nThat 1 was throwing 'in v the cluteh, ' or\nit had: Ihnf effect pn\" the horse, for nt\nthoso words the horse started, responding\npromptly nnd yet with a certain delibera\ntivenes3 of movement that seemed quite\nappropriate to a horse of habit approach\ning portliness. Starting thus, he kept\nmoving at a slow, even, uniform walk.\nHo was now on low.\nWhen tho horse had proceeded thus for\na matter of maybe twenty feet tho man\nin the buggy spoke again in the same\ncalm, even tone as before and in the\nenme words:\n\"Come up.\"\nThis time it was equivalent to shifting\nthe gears, and at once in responso tho\nhorse started-up on a short stepped, easy,\nslow jog trot.\nAnd that was his high, apparently, for\nho 'was' still going in -that manner when\nhe.pasaefl out of this observer's 'eye. \"\n1\nI\nt I\ni\nvv H ? $\nUR THOMAS WHITE\nC4M4DAN MNfSTER OF FINANCE\n$700,000,000, which will be a billion by\nthe end of the year. In the four years of\nthe war Canada has bought from the\nUnited States according to the National\nCity -Bank statistician $2,350,000,000\nsurely a customer worth favored nation\ntreatment financially.\nJler system of issuing war loans was,\nfirst to make them absolutely tax free. Tbo\nnext step was to prevent what has been\nhappening too often in the United Stales,\nlferc, under the enthusiasm of the mo\nment', people and institutions would sub\nscribe for a good round total of Liberty\nbonds. They would put down their first\npayment, then before the bonds began to\nsag below par throw them on the market\nfor resale.\nThe result was while other people were\nbuying Liberty bonds to hold them nnd\nborrowing from the banks to pay the in\nstalments, before they had their final pay\nment made, the bonds they were paying\nfor-at par had slipped 2, 3, 4 below par;\nand the less patriotic subscribers who\nwaited for bafgaina could pick those .\nbonds up cheaper than the people who\nwent in debt to buy.\nVictory Loans Kept Up to Par.\nCanada prevented all this by a simp\ndevice. A Victory Loan special committee\nwas 'formed to operate with bond dealers\nto purchase war loans at fixed prices. The\ncommittee and dealers then find individual\npurchasers for the bonds, and on disposal\nthe committee pays the dealers a small\nfixed commission. No commission is paid\nwhen the dealers sell to the committee, hut\nonly when a sslc is made to a purchaser.\nThis prevents dealers liquidating unsold\nbonds below par and gets the bonds in tho\nhands of permanent investors.\nThe committee stands ready to buy any\namount of war bonds for sale, and scales\nthe prices only for largo blocks sufficient\nto cover underwriting expenses. Denier ,\nmust sell at a fixed price to the public.\nThe price was first fixed at 9S\"s. It was\nthen advanced to 99V. Last month it was\nplaced at par. Tho advance was the result\nof demand by tho public for bonds that\ndid not sag. The commission paid to the\ndealers was sufficient to stimulate sales.\nIt ran at first at 1 per cent.

An American in\nsearch of a new home might locate In\ntlif- northernmost tier of sections in\nNortfe Dakota, but he would never\ndne&m of crossing over to the south\nernmost tier of sections in Manitoba.\nA great change has been wrought.\nNow. it is well understood that the\navlTi at bolt crosses the international\nlh>e in a northwesterly direction and\nexpends much farther, west in Canada\nthan it does in the United States. Now\nit 'is generally understood that the\nvirgin prairies of Western Canada are\nBoon to become the greatest spring\nat producing region in the world,\nand that in many other forms of agri\nculture that part of Canada is to take\na prominent place.\nBeginning of a Great Movement\nJi was about seven years ago that\n.Americans began to realize that West\nern Canada was a country worth In\nvestigating. It was then that the ac\ntivity in Northwestern lands began,\nand its natural result was soon to\ncause American land men and persons\ndesirous of cheap homes to investi\ngate what Western Canada had to\noffer. The result of these first inves\ntigations were so satisfactory that\nthere later arose what might almost\nbe called a boom in the farm lands\nof Western Canada. Capitalists from\nthe United States went into Manitoba,\nSaskatchewan, Alberta and Assiniboia\nby, ihe carload, and landseekers and\nBettlers by the trajnload. In the last\nB( \\\"<'!i years 132,000 Americans have\nBelled in Western Canada. Last year\nalone the number of immigrants hail\ning from the United States exceeded\n49,000, and the movement continues\nvery large this year and will doubtless\nbe* a fixed feature of the continuous\nmigrations of people on the American\ncontinent for many years to come.\nProm an American point of view it\nmay be. considered unfortunate that\nthere is so much good country on this\ncontinent outside of the United States,\nbut since the fact is that there are\nabout 400,000 square miles of good ag\nricultural country in Western Canada,\ni; is merely in the nature of things that\nAmericans should cross over the line\nimd settle in the new country. The\ntygical American is always keen to bet\nter his condition, and though he may\nregret that the pursuit of prosperity\ntakes him away from the land of his\nbirth, he is very apt to consult his ma\nteuial interests and put aside the sentl\nmental drawback.\nNot a Great Change\nThe fact that the Canadians speak\nthe- same language as Americans, that\ntheir political and social institutions\nfire very similar to ours, and, indeed,\n<<!i~n copied from them, tend to make\nthe change from the United States to\niia an easy one.

The\" district school is at\nhand for his - children, and there is a\ncomplete system of education from , the\nkindergarten to the university.

If he\nlooks \u25a0 to. his social relations, he finds\nthat the composition- of the community\nin which he has settled is nowise dis\nsimilar from that of thousands of com\nmunities in the United States. He\nfinds a stable banking system, whose\nsolidity is the admiration of American\nfinanciers, and he 'finds a currency . that\nis as reliable as any in the 1 world. The\ncost of living is about the same as in\nthe United \u25a0 States, possibly ; a little\nhigher, though there are certain kinds\nof goods that are much cheaper in\nCanada than in the United ; States, on\naccount of the higher American tariff..\n< * *, >\nThe Land of Wheat\nThe staple product of Wester* Can\nada is wheat, and wheat will doubtless\nbe king for many yeaxs to come,. The\nchanging conditions of agriculture In\nthe United States are forcing Western\nCanada to become a great wheat coun\ntry. As population increases in the\nUnited States and the extent of cheap\nor free land in the West decreases\nthere is a marked tendency, for the\nwheat acreage to decline. Ever\nsince the conquest'of the American wil\nderness began there has been a steady\nturning over of land from wheat to\nother crops, but until recently the\nincrease in the acreage on account of\nthe occupation of new farming coun\ntry more than offset the loss by reason\nof change. Now, however, there is\npractically no more virgin country in\nthe United States suitable for wheat\ngrowing. The farmers find, as has\never been found before them, that\nthere are more profitable ways of\nhandling: high-priced land adjacent to\nlarge markets than raising wheat. In\nWestern Canada, however, the land is\ncheap and has been occupied only in a\nsmall part. The conditions are favor\nable to large farms, and for large\nfarms there is no better crop than\nwheat, because it can be handled with\na minimum of labor and expense and\nalways finds a ready market. The\ngradual withdrawal of a large portion\nof the present United States acreage\nfrom wheat raising will make it nec\nessary for some other country to make\nup the large quantities of wheat the\nUnited States formerly exported to the\nmarkets of the world. No country is\nbetter suited than Canada to succeed\nthe United States in this work of pro\nviding white bread for the overpopu\nlated countries.\nExtensive Railway Building\nThe railway building now going on\nin Western Canada makes it certain\nthat the country will be well provided\nwith means of transport. The Cana\ndian Northern Is building on to Ed\nmonton, 800 milea northwest of Win\nnipeg, besides branch lines. The Ca\nnadian Pacific is at work on several\nbranch lines with an aggregate mileage\nof several hundred miles. The Grand\nTrunk Pacific, keeping pace with the\nexpansion of the Dominion, is about to\nbegin work on a transcontinental rail\nway that will begin at Moncton, N.\n8., and end at Port Simpson, B. C.\nThis line will pass through Winnipeg,\nand between that city and Edmonton\nwill take \"a course north of the main\nline of the Canadian Pacific and south\nof the main line of the Canadian\nNorthern. Freight rates on the Cana\ndian railways are well known to be\nvery reasonable, so that a great dis\ntance from the market is not a serious\ndrawback to farming operations.\nIt now seems probable that within\na few years a railway will be built\nfrom the Western Canadian wheat belt\nto some point on Hudson's bay. When\nthat is done the larger part of the\nwheat produced in Western Canada\nwill be within a few hundred miles\nhaul of salt water, and the distance to\nthe British markets will be reduced by\na thousand miles. Western Canada\nwill then be much nearer to the world's\nmarkets than the western part of the\nUnited States.\nPopulation Western Canada in 1901 ....... ...^...- r... 441,370\nPopulation Western Canada in 1904 700,000\nProbable population in 1911 v... .2,000,000\nWheat crop Western Canada in 1900 17,000,000 bushels\nWheat crop Western Canada in 1902 68,000,000 \"\nPossible yield this year.. 80,000,000 \"\nTotal wheat acreage this year r. 3,400*000 acres\nTotaJ acreage all crops 5,600,000\nAverage annual income per farm from grain alone $1,600\nAnnual immigration tOO,OOO\nAnnual immigration of Americans 50,000\nAverage yield of wheat per acre in Manitoba for 20 years .19.17 bushels\nAverage yield of wheat per acre in Manitoba for the last\ncix years 22i05 bushels\nAverage yield of wheat per acre in Alberta, Assiniboia\nand Saskatchewan for last six years 19.42 bushels\nNumber of homestead entries, 1901 9,108\nNumber of homestead entries, 1902 22,215\nNumber of homestead entries, t903. 32,\u00ab82\nTotal a*ea disposed of by land grant companies in 1903 4,229*011 acres\nTotal area disposed of by the government in 1903 5,158,550 \"\nIMPERIAL BANK\nOF CANADA\nCAPITAL {paid up) .... $3,000,000\nREST ACCOUNT ..... $2,850,000\nHEAD OFFICE TORONTO.\nT.

It is rich and\ngetting richer. It is growing fast, but\nnot so fast as the population of its\ntributary country. It has hopes of a\ngreat future, but it is so busy taking\ncare of a magnificent present that it\nhas little time to dream dreams of the\ngolden tomorrow.\nThree years ago Winnipeg had 42,\n--000 people; today it has near 75,000.\nThe railroads are building thousands\nof miles of railway in Western Canada\nand every mile pays toll to Winnipeg;\npeople are coming into Western Can\nada at the rate of 10,000 a month, and\nevery one of them must sooner or later\npay tribute to Winnipeg. It is the\ncommercial center of Western Canada\nas well as for the vast regions of the\nmysterious north. It is only sixty miles\nnorth of the boundary line, but it is\nnear 800 miles from St. Paul. On the\neast Toronto and Montreal are more\nthan a thousand miles away. All the\nmeshes of the railway lines that give\ncoipmercial life to Western Canada are\ngathered *up and bound together at\nWinnipeg.\nWhat Chicago Is to the American\nWest Winnipeg is to the Canadian\n\u2022West, and just as the growth of its\ntributary country made Chicago great\nand rich* and powerful, so will the sure\ndevelopment of Manitoba, Assiniboia\nand Saskatchewan make Winnipeg one\nof the great world cities. The Canadian\nWest will one day have a population of\nat least 25,000,000. Winnipeg should\nthen have a population of more than a\nmillion. Careful estimates give Winni\npeg 400,000 people in twenty years.\nTwenty years ago Winnipeg was a\ncluster of shacks sheltering 10,000 peo\nple. Today it is a city, so far as its\nbusiness portion Is concerned, of solid\nstone and brick buildings, assessed at\n143,000,000, and housing a population\nof about 75,000. No city of its class on\nthe continent is growing so rapidly as\nWinnipeg today.\nDevelopment of Winnipeg\nThe first railway, the old St. Paul,\nMinneapolis & Manitoba, now the\nGreat Northern, reached Winnipeg in\n1879. and in 1881 and 1882 the city\nwent through a boom and collapse\nwhich left it almost forgotten for a\nnumber of years. In 1884 the Canadian\nPacific railway completed its line from\n~ Winnipeg to Port Arthur and began\nbuilding branch lines which made\nWinnipeg an important railway cen\nter. The Canadian Pacific was com\npleted across the continent in 1887, and\nsince then Winnipeg has grown stead\nily, If the recent very rapid growth\nmay be so described. In 1&01, when\nthe population of the city had reached\n43,000, the bank clearings were $134,\n--000,000. The next year they were up to\n$188,000,000, while last year they went\nto $250,000,000. One of the wonders of\nWinnipeg is the enormous massive bank\nbuildings of the chartered banks. The\ntotal capita] of the thirteen chartered\nbanks having branches at Winnipeg\nexceeds $35,000,000, and their assets are\nmore than $88,000,000. As a financial\ncenter Winnipeg is now the third city\nin Canada, being outranked only by\nMontreal and Toronto, passing such\nold cities as Hamilton, Ottawa, Lon\ndon and Quebec.\nExtensive Jobbing Center\nOne of the features of Winnipeg that\ngreatly impresses a visitor is the large\nnumber of wholesale buildings. There\nis probably no city of its size in the\nworld that does such a large jobbing\n250,000 square miles of good agricul\ntural country in Western Canada.\nNo Surplus of Good Land\nIt should not be concluded from\nstatements about the vast extent of\ngood agricultural country In Western\nCanada that there Is so much of It\nthat for many years there can be no\ngreat rise in land values. Only a por\ntion of the country is adapted to suc\ncessful wheat raising; much of It la\nbetter fitted for general agriculture.\nThe most conservative authorities hold\nthat only about 25 per cent of the\narea of Western Canada Is suited to\nwheat raising, while others estimate it\nto be as high aa 50 per cent or more.\ntrade. There are scores of blocks of\nsubstantial white brick buildings that\ntestify to the volume of commerce han\ndled by the jobbers of Winnipeg. The\ncity is not yet much of a manufactur\ning center, but it has at hand enor\nmous undeveloped water power which\nwill one day make it a great manufac\nturing center. On the Winnipeg river, -\nbetween Lake of the Woods and Lake\nWinnipeg, it is possible to utilize 240,\n--000 horsepower. The Winnipeg General\nPower company is now at work on the\ndevelopment of a part of this power,\nand within ten months 10,000 horse\npower will be available for use in the\ncity. The Assiniboine river, which flows\ninto the Red river within the city, has\na considerable fall, and it la only a j\nquestion of a short time until this \\\npower also will be utilized. There are i\ngood openings in many lines of man- \u25a0\nufactures.\nWinnipeg as a Home\nWinnipeg is a good city to live in. ,\nIts summer weather is about the same\nas that of St. Paul and Minneapolis,\nexcept that it has fewer hot nights,\nand its winter weather is not\" much\ncolder. It is a clean, pleasant-looking \u201e\ncity, with streets neatly paved with ,\nasphalt, block or macadam. The city. H\nowns its own waterworks plant, and\nwater is drawn from artesian wells.\nThe flre department is efficient, and\nAmerican experts declare that the po\nlice force is as good as any on the con\ntinent. The city has 125 miles of grad\ned streets, sixteen miles of block pave\nments, thirty miles of macadam and\nfifteen miles of asphalt. There are 179\nmiles of plank sidewalk and sixteen\nmiles of granolithic walk; seventy\nmiles of sewer and eighty miles of\nwater main. One of the physical fea\ntures of the city that pleases all vis\nitors is the width of the streets. Most\nof the leading thoroughfares are 133\nfeet wide and none is narrower than\nsixty-six feet. The city has six large\nparks and numerous school buildings,\nsurrounded by ample playgrounds.\nThe twenty handsome public school\nbuildings in Winnipeg have a capacity\nof over 10,000 pupils and aie maintain\ned at a cost of more than $200,000 a\nyear. There is an excellent academy,\nbesides the University of Manitoba.\nWinnipeg Is more like an American\ncity than any other city in Canada,\nand its population is fully as cosmo\npolitan as that of the average Amer\nican city.\nWinnipeg Is Prosperous\nThe influx of people into the West,\nthe extensive railway building, the\nutilization of water power and' the\nmany improvements being wrought in\nthe city by the Canadian Pacific rail\nway and the Canadian Northern rail\nway, in addition to building improve\nments amounting to about $7,000,000 a\nyear, have all combined to make Win\nnipeg exceedingly prosperous at this\ntime. The town is full of life and ac\ntivity.

In a vague sort of way there\ncame to his mind a vision of a cold,\nbarren country, scarcely fit for human\nhabitation and occupied only by In\ndians and a few devoted but misguided\nBritish patriots who would live almost\nanywhere if they could be under the\nflag of Britain.\nWestern Canada: Today the words\nconvey an impression of a country\nabounding in natural resources, the\nbest hard wheat country in the world;\na country of expanding improvements,\nof great creative energy, of amazing\nmaterial progress, a good country in\nwhich to seek industrial independence,\na good country in which to live.\nIt used to be thought that nature,\nalways so kind to the American na\ntion, had carried her bounty to the\nlimit and capped the climax by mak\ning the northern boundary of good\nagricultural land on this continent co\nincide with the northern boundary of\nthe United States. An American In\nsearch of a new home might locate in\nthe northernmost tier of sections in\nNorth Dakota, but he would never\ndream of crossing over to the south\nernmost tier of sections in Manitoba.\nA great change has been wrought.\nNow it is wrell understood that the\nwheat belt crosses the international\nline in a northwesterly direction and\nextends much farther west in Canada\nthan it does in the United States. Now\nIs is generally understood that the\nvirgin prairies of Western Canada are\nsoon to become the greatest spring\nwheat producing region in the world,\nand that in many other forms of agri\nculture that part of Canada is to take\na prominent place.\nBeginning of a Great Movement\nIt was about seven years ago thai\nAmericans began to realize that West\nern Canada was a country worth in\nvestigating. It was then that the ac\ntivity in Northwestern lands began,\nand its natural result was soon to\ncause American land men and persons\ndesirous of cheap homes to investi\ngate what Western Canada had to\noffer. The result of these first Inves\ntigations were so satisfactory that\nthere later arose what might almost\nbe called a boom in the farm lands\nof Western Canada. Capitalists from\nthe United States went into Manitoba,\nSaskatchewan, Alberta and Assinibola\nby the carload, and landseekers and\nsettlers by the trainload. In the last\nseven years 132,000 Americans have\nsettled in Western Canada. Last year\nalone the number of immigrants hail\ning from the United States exceeded\n49,000. and the movement continues\nvery large this year and will doubtless\nbe a fixed feature of the continuous\nmigrations of people on the American\ncontinent for many years to come.\nFrom an American point of view it\nmay be considered unfortunate that\nthere is so much good country on this\ncontinent outside of the United States,\nbut since the fact is that there are\nabout 400,000 square miles of good ag\nricultural country in Western Canada,\nit is merely in the nature of things that\nAmericans should cross over the line\nand settle in the new country. The\ntypical American is always keen to\nbetter his condition, and though he\nmay regret that the pursuit of pros\nperity takes him away from the land\nof his birth, he is very apt to consult\nhis material intreests and put aside\nthe sentimental drawback.\nNot a Great Change\nThe fact that the Canadians speak\nthe same language as Americans, that\ntheir political and social institutions\nare very similar to ours and, indeed,\noften copied from them, tend to make\nthe change from the United States to\nCanada an easy one. The settler, lured\nto Western Canada by cheap or free\nand fertile lands, would hardly know\nthat he had moved from one nation\nto another except that he sometimes\nsees the red flag of Britain where he\nhad been wont to see the stars and\nstripes. He finds efficient local, pro\nvincial and general goverments. He\nfinds about the same sort of civil and\ncriminal law that he has been ac\ncustomed to, he finds that laws are\nenforced and order maintained. The\nLOOK FOR HOMES\nm Sheep on a Ranch at Crane Lake, IN. W. T\ndistrict school is at hand for his chil\ndren, and there is a complete system\nof education from the kindergarten\nto the university. The American finds\nthe cities and towns to be about the\nsame as corresponding communities\nin the United States. The architecture\nis the same and the methods of doing\nbusiness are not dissimilar. In the\nstores he finds about the same class of\ngoods as he would find in like stores\nin the United States. If he looks to\nhis social relations, he finds that the\ncomposition of the community in which\nhe has settled is nowise dissimilar from\nthat of thousands of communities in\nthe United States. He finds a stable\nbanking system, whose solidity is the\nadmiration of American financiers, and\nhe finds a currency that is as reliable\nas any in the world. The cost of living\nis about the same as in the United\nStates, possibly a little higher, though\nthere are certain kinds of goods that\nare much cheaper in Canada than in\nthe United States, on account of th\u00bb r\nhigher American tariff.\nThe Land of Wheat\nThe staple product of Western Can\nada is wheat, and wheat will doubtless\nte king for many years to come. The\ncharging conditions of agriculture in\nthe United States are forcing Western\nC&nada to become a great wheat\ncountry. As population increases in\nthe United States and the extent of\ncheap or free land in the West de\ncreases there is a marked tendency for\nthe wheat acreage to decline. Ever\nsrfnce the conquest of the American wil\nderness began there has been a steady\nturning over of land from wheat to\nother crops, but until recently the\nincrease in the acreage on account of\nthe occupation of new farming coun\ntry more than offset the loss by reason\nof change. Now, however, there is\npractically no more virgin country in\ntho United States suitable for wheat\ngrowing. The farmers find, as has\never been found before them, that\nthere are more profitable ways of\nhandling high-priced land adjacent to\nlarge markets than raising wheat. In\nWestern Canada, however, the land is\ncheap and has been occupied only in a\nsmall part. The conditions are favor\nable to large farms, and for large\nfarms there is no better crop than\nwheat, because it can be handled with\na minimum of labor and expense and\nalways finds a ready market. The\ngradual withdrawal of a large portion\nof the present United States acreage\nfrom wheat raising will make it nec\nessary for some other country to make\nup the large quantities of wheat the\nUnited States formerly exported to the\nmarkets of the world. No country is\nbetter suited than Canada to succeed\nthe United States in this work of pro\nviding white bread for the over-popu\nlated countries than Canada.\nExtensive Railway Building\nThe railway building now going on\nin Western Canada makes it certain\nthat the country will be well provided\nwith means of transport. The Cana\ndian Northern is building on to Ed\nmonton, 800 miles northwest of Win\nnipeg, besides branch lines. The Ca\nnadian Pacific is at work on several\nbranch lines ,with an aggregate mileage\ncf several hundred miles. The Grand\nTrunk Pacific, keeping pace with the\nexpansion of the Dominion, is about to\nbegin work on a transcontinental^ rail\nway that will begin at Moncton, N.\n8., and end at Port Simpson, B. C.\nThis line will pass through Winnipeg,\nand between that city and Edmonton\nwill take a course north of the main\nline of the Canadian Pacific and south\nof the main line of the Canadian\nNorthern. Freight rates on the Cana\ndian railways are well known to be\nvery reasonable, so that a great dis\ntance from the market is not a serious\ndrawback to farming operations.\nIt now seems probable that within\na few years a railway will be built\nfrom the Western Canadian wheat belt\nto some point on Hudson's bay. When\nthat is done the larger part of the\nwheat produced in Western Canada\nwill be within a few hundred miles\nhaul of salt water, and the distance to\nthe British markets will be reduced by\na thousand miles. Western Canada\nwill then be much nearer to the\nworld's markets than the western part\nof the United States-\nTHE m.

It is rich and\ngetting richer. It is growing fast, but\nnot so fast as the population of its\ntributary country. It has hopes of a\ngreat fature, but it is so busy taking\ncare of a magnificent present that it\nhas little time to dream dreams of the\ngolden tomorrow.\nThree years ago Winnipeg had 42,\n--000 people; today it has near 75,000.\nThe railroads are building thousands\nof miles of railway in \"Western Canada\nand every mile pays toll to Winnipeg;\npeople are coming into Western Can\nada at the rate of 10,000 a month, and\nevery one of them must sooner or later\npay tribute to Winnipeg. It is the\ncommercial center of Western Canada\nas well as for the vast regions of the\nmysterious north. It is only sijfty miles\nnorth of the boundary line, but it Is\nnear 500 miles from St. Paul. On the\neast Toronto and Montreal are more\nthan a thousand miles away. All the\nmeshes of the railway lines that give\ncommercial life to Western Canada are\ngathered up and bound together at\nWinnipeg.\nWhat Chicago is to the American\nWest Winnipeg is to the Canadian\nWest, and just as the growth of its\ntributary country made Chicago great\nand rich and powerful so will the sure\ndevelopment of Manitoba, Assiniboia\nand Saskatchewan make Winnipeg one\nof the great world cities. The Canadian\nWest will one day have a population of\nat least 25,000,000. Winnipeg should\nthen have a population or more than a\nmillion. Careful estimates give Winni\npeg 400,000 people in twenty years.\nTwenty years ago Winnipeg was a\ncluster of shacks sheltering 10,000 peo\nple. Today it is a city, so far as its\nbusiness portion is concerned, of solid\nstone and brick buildings, assessed at\n$43,000,000, and housing a population\nof about 75,000. No city of its class on\nthe continent is growing so rapidly as\nWinnipeg today.\nDevelopment of Winnipeg\nThe first railway, the old St. Paul.\nMinneapolis & Manitoba, now the\nGreat Northern, reached Winnipeg in\n1879, and in \u25a0 1881 and 1882 the city\nwent through a boom and collapse\nwhich left it almost forgotten for a\nnumber of years. In 1884 the Canadian\nPacific railway completed its line from\nWinnipeg to Port Arthur and began\nbuilding branch lines which made\nWinnipeg an important railway cen\nter. The Canadian Pacific was com\npleted across the continent in 1887, and\nsince then Winnipeg has grown stead\nily, if the recent very rapid growth\nmay be so described. In 1901, when\nthe population of the city had reached\n43,000, the bank clearings were $134,\n--000,000. The next year they were up to\n$188,000,000, while last year they went\nto $250,000,000. One of the wonders of\nWinnipeg is the enormous massive bank\nbuildings of the chaptered banks. The\ntotal capital of the thirteen chartered\nbanks having branches at Winnipeg\nexceeds $35,000,000, and their assets are\nmore than $88,000,000. As a financial\ncenter Winnipeg is now the third city\nin Canada, being outranked only by\nMontreal and Toronto, passing such\nold cities as Hamilton, Ottawa, Lon\ndon and Quebec.\nExtensive Jobbing Center\nOne of the features of Winnipeg that\ngreatly impresses a visitor is the large\nnumber of wholesale buildings. There\nis probably no city of its size in the\nworld that does such a large jobbing\n250,000 square miles of good agricuul\ntural country in Western Canada.\nNo Surplus of Good Land\nIt should not be concluded from\nstatements about the vast extent of\ngood agricultural country in Western\nCanada that there is so much of it\nthat for many years there can be no\ngreat rise in land values. Only a por\ntion of the country is adapted to suc\ncessful wheat raising; much ,of it is\nbetter fitted for general agriculture.\nThe most conservative authorities hold\nthat only about 25 per cent of the\narea of Western Canada is suited to\nwheat raising, while others estimate\nit to be as higb as 50 per cent or more.\ntrade. There are scores of blocks of\nsubstantial white brick buildings that\ntestify to the volume of commerce han\ndled by the jobbers of Winnipeg. The\ncity is not yet much of a manufactur\ning center, but it has at hand enor\nmous undeveloped water power which\nwill one day make It a great manufac\nturing center. On the Winnipeg river,\nbetween Lake of the Woods and Lake\nWinnipeg, It is possible to utilize 240,000\nhorsepower. The Winnipeg General\nPower company Is now at work on tha\ndevelopment of a part of this power,\nand within ten months 10,000 ho'rs*e-'\npower will be available for use in the\ncity. The. Assiniboine river, which flows\ninto the Red river within the city, has\na considerable fall, and it is only a\nquestion of a short time until JJhJa\npower also will be utilized. There are\ngood openings in many lines of manu\nfactures.\nWinnipeg As a Home\nWinnipeg is a good city to live In.\nIts summer weather Is about the same\nas that of St. Paul and Minneapolis,\nexcept that it has fewer hot nights,\nand its winter weather is not much\ncolder. It is a clean, pleasant-looking\ncity, with streets neatly paved with\nasphalt, block or macadam. The city\nowns its own waterworks plant, and\nwater is drawn from artesian wells.\nThe fire department is efficient and\nAmerican experts declare that the po\nlice force is as good as any on the con\ntinent. The city has 125 miles of grad\ned streets, sixteen miles of block pave\nments, thirty miles of macadam and\nfifteen miles of asphalt. There are 179\nmiles of plank sidewalk and sixteen\nmiles of granolithic walk; seventy\nmiles of sewer and eighty miles oC\nwater main. One of the physical fea\ntures of the city that pleases all vis\nitors is the width of the streets. Most\nof the leading thoroughfares are 133\nfeet wide and none are narrower than\nsixty-six feet. The city has six large\nparks and numerous school buildings,\nsurrounded by ample playgrounds.\nThe twenty handsome public school\nbuildings in Winnipeg have a capacity\nof over 10,000 pupils and are maintain\ned at a cost of more than $200,000 a\nyear. There is an excellent academy,\nbesides the University of Manitoba.\nWinnipeg is more like an American\ncity than any other city in Canada,\nand its population is fully as cosmo\npolitan as that of the average Amer\nican city.\nWinnipeg Is Prosperous\nThe influx of people into the West,\nthe extensive railway building, th\u00ab\nutilization of water power and the\nmany Improvements being wrought In\nthe city by the Canadian Pacific rail\nway and the Canadian Northern rail\nway, in addition to building improve\nments amounting to about $7,000,000 a\nyear, have all combined to make Win\nnipeg exceedingly prosperous at this\ntime. The town is full of life and ac\ntivity. The hotels are all overcrowded\nand the real estate market is so ac\ntive that property changes hands very\nrapidly and a great deal of money Is\nbeing made by investment In city lots.\nThe numbers of the American colony\nin Winnipeg have grown so rapidly of\nlate that the Americans are coming to\nbe the very noticeable element in the\nbusiness circles of the city. There is so\nlittle difference between life in Winni\npeg and life in any northern city of\nthe United States, and the laws and In\nstitutions and customs of the United\nStates are so much like those of Can\nada that persons who seek to better\nthemselves individually by taking ad\nvantage of the numerous opportunities\npresented by this young and growing\ncountry find little inconvenience In\nmaking the change.\nMoreover, it does not take a very\nlarge population to accomplish the\ngeneral settlement and ccupation of a\nvery extensive territory. Western\nCanada farms will average at least 200\nacres. At that rate 115 settlers will\noccupy a township, and 800,000 people\nwill completely occupy an area of 250,\n--000 square miles. As Western Canada\nis now getting about 100,000 new set\ntlers a year, to say nothing of the nat\nural increase of population,, It is plain\nthat no great length of time will elapse.\nuntil all the land now offered so cheap\nly by railways and land companies and\ngiven away by the government wil'\nhave changed hands.", "batch": "mnhi_quamba_ver01", "title_normal": "saint paul globe.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059523/1904-07-03/ed-1/seq-70.json", "place": ["Minnesota--Ramsey--Saint Paul"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 29, "county": ["Wayne"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Biweekly", "id": "/lccn/sn83045399/1944-12-30/ed-1/seq-29/", "subject": ["Detroit (Mich.)--Newspapers.", "Michigan--Detroit.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01205010", "Michigan--Wayne County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01206628", "Michigan.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01208387", "Romanian Americans--Newspapers.", "Romanian Americans.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01099946", "Romanians--Michigan--Newspapers.", "Romanians.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01100068", "Wayne County (Mich.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Detroit"], "date": "19441230", "title": "Roma\u0302nul American.

Prema tome u cijeloj go\ndini primili smo svotu od \u00a71,467,023.77.\nVrijednost na\u0161ih bondova koncem godine 1958\nSvr\u0161etkom godine 1957 vrijednost na\u0161ih bondova fz\nB&dala je \u00a724,596,985.17. Koncem godine 1958 izna\u0161a $25,\n564,760.03. Dakle knji\u017eevna vrijednost bondova porasla je\nza \u00a7967,774.86. To je, kako vidite, ipak lijepi porast u na\n\u0161oj imovini ulo\u017eenoj u bondove.\nUkupna imovina Zajednice\nPred godinu dana na\u0161a ukupna imovina izna\u0161ala je svo\ntu od \u00a726,884,495.28. Koncem godine 1958 imovina je iz\nna\u0161ala svotu od \u00a727,887,493.30. Dakle u godini 1958 cjelo\nkupna imovina porasla je za svotu od \u00a71,002,998.02.\nGodine 1957 primili smo na ra\u010dun kamata \u00a7790,748.29.\nU pro\u0161loj godini, naime u 1958 god., primili smo \u00a7839,563.33.\nJedno potrebno obja\u0161njenje\nU ovom izvje\u0161\u0107u iznesene su brojke, koje ulaze u mili\njune dolara, kako kod prodaje, tako i kod kupnje novih bon\ndova. Ako nebi ovo objasnio mnogi bi mogao dobiti dojam,\nda amo u pro\u0161loj godini prodali veliki dio bondova, pak bi\nmogao pitati, \u0161to je bio razlog, da je prodano bondova\nvrijednosti od preko milijun dolara.\nU drugih \u0161est mjeseci pro\u0161le godine mi smo izmijenili\n$804,000 Dominion of Canada 6th, 7th, 8th i 9th Victory\nLoan 3% za novo izdanje \"Government of Canada, Conver\nsion Loan 4a/2 %\". Povrh toga \u0161to smo izmijenili ovu ogrom\nnu svotu bondova i to sa 3% na 41o/'f mi smo povrh toga\nprimili kao premium u iznosu od $13,301.25, \u0161to je za nas\n\u010disti dobitak ili profit. Ova izmjena, ove lijepe svote sa 3%\nna 41/2% \u0107e nam znatno omogu\u0107iti ve\u0107i prihod na kamati\nma za ovu godinu.\nU na\u0161im izvje\u0161tajima mi moramo nositi ove bondove,\nkao \"Bonds Disposed\", jer smo ih se rije\u0161ili, a zatim \"Bonds\nPurchased\", jer smo zaista dobili nove bondove. U stvari tu\nnije bilo ni prodaje ni kupnje, ve\u0107 izmjena sa manjih na ve\n\u0107e kamate.\nProdali smo \u00a7145,000 United States Treasury 2V2% i\nto na gubitak, ali taj gubitak \u0107e biti nadoknadjen u kratko\nvrijeme, jer ti bondovi su nam nosili manje od 2V2%, jer\nkada su kupljeni bili su pla\u0107eni na premium. Dok imademo\nve\u0107i iznoe ovih bondova, kao i nekih drugih, koji nam nose\n\u2022lanje od 2V2% kamate te\u0161ko je pokazati primjetljivi go\ndi\u0161nji porast u kamatima. Nu ipak mi stalno u zadnjih ne\nkoliko godina pokazujemo porast na kamatima i tako pro\nHe godine na\u0161i kamati izna\u0161aju 3.23%.\nMi bi mogli jo\u0161 vi\u0161e pove\u0107ati prihod na kamatima, ako\nbi prodali recimo sve bondove, koji nam nose niske kamate.\nAli kod toga bi gubili na glavnici, jer svi takovi bondovi se\ndanas prodaju ispod cijene, koju smo mi platili u vrijeme\nkada se nije moglo kupiti bondove na \"par\" i na vi\u0161e ka\nmate, kao \u0161to je to danas mogu\u0107e. Vi mo\u017eete vidjeti u mo\njem izvje\u0161\u0107u, koje vam je predano, da ve\u0107 dulje vremena\nmi kupujemo bondove koji nam nose sve od 4 do 5 pro\ncenata, a po nekad i vi\u0161e. Ali od vremena na vrijeme, mi\nfemo prodati stanoviti broj takovih bondova, a naro\u010dito bi\nJ|P u\u010dinili tada, ako bi im cijena donekle i\u0161la gore.\nMi jo\u0161 uvijek kupujemo bolje vrsti bondove i to samo\nna preporuku savjetuju\u0107e firme. Tako mislimo i proslijediti\nBondovi u defaultu\nMi posjedujemo $100,000 Burt County, Nebraska bon\ndova, koji ne pla\u0107aju kamate. Mi u stvari imademo \u00a775,000\nulo\u017eeno u te bondove, jer smo primili \u00a725,000.00. Kod tih\nbondova nema zna\u010dajne promjene,ali ima nade, da \u0107e se jed\nR\u00b0g dana stanje istih popraviti. Most je u prometu, ali pri\ntiod jo\u0161 nije dovoljan da ispla\u0107uje kamate na ove bondove,\nJer prije ispla\u0107uje kamate na bondove, koji su izdani nakon\n*nih, koje mi dr\u017eimo. Sada se radi na tome, da se sagradi\n,*i\u0161e puteva ili prilaza istom mostu, da se na taj na\u010din po\nve\u0107a promet na mostu.\n\"GOLD MEDAL\" BRA\u0160NO\nEE NA\u0160E ZALIHE NA RIJECI\nnudimo uz cijenu\nIM LBS.

SUNDAY, FEBRUARY r,'.1918.\nCanada's Racial Gulf Widened by Election\nb \" yjy .'fiy , -\nNON COMMISSIONED OFFICERS aj MEN o FORT GARRY HORSE VOTING OTI CONSCRIPTION AFTER z FIGHTING OIIAe CAMBRC1 FRONT.\nW ivraiern wwjffcr union ,\nBy-FRANK MAITLAND.\nA FEW thousand political prophets\niu Canada !iac lost their repu\ntations. The swopping victory of the\nnew Union Government ami its policy\nof conscription by selective draft wa-t not\nexported by the political seers. An even\nbreak, or a small opposition majority on\ntliu home vote, which would be converted\ninto a reahfialily sufficient working ma\njority for the Government when the re\nbels of the soldiers' voting became known\n' late in January, was the result which was\nlooked for by most of tluce who are\ndeemed politically astute. On election\nnight it was\" demonstrated conclusively\nthat the heart of English speaking Can\nada i sound, that when confronted with\nthe s'.crn realities of the desperate situa\ntion of the present hour the English\nspeaking people of Canada do not shrink\nfrom saorilice, but an; resolved and pre\npared to endure to the end.\nSo long as Canadian history lasts the\nion.-, and daughters of the Dominion will\nremember December 17, 1917, with justi\nfiable, patriotic pride. It had Imhmi said\nthat no free people hail ever voted for ita\nown conscription; that .because it was re\nferred to popular vote the cause of com\npulsory military service in Canada was\nnecessarily lost. The event justified the\nconfidence of those who believe that in\nevery real crisis of the nation's history\nthe safe course is to trust the people. A\nparliamentary majority almost as large\nas any in Canadian history, n popular\nmajority such as no other Canadian Gov\nernment had ever been so fortunate us to\nobtain, were given the Union Government\nby the home voters in December.\nThe soldier vote is admitted to be al\nmost a unit for the Government and its\nselective draft policy. When the soldiers'\nballots are assigned some time this month\nto the individual constituencies large in\ncrease will be made in the majorities of\nGovernment candidates, and a number of\nopposition candidates apparently elected\nin December will almost certainly be de\nfeated. It is doubtful if Sir Wilfrid\nLaurier will have more thau twelve or fif\nteen Parliamentary supporters from the\neight provinces other than Quebec, and\nnearly all of these will owe their election\nto French Canadian votes.\nTherein lies the unsatisfactory and in\ndeed the daugerous aspect of the uaw\npolitiral'-bituation in Canada. The cou\nscription issue and the apathetic attitude\nof Quebec toward Canada's part in the\ngreat war have created a new alignment\nof political parties. In the new House\nof Commons a solid French speaking op\nposition, led by Sir Wilfrid Laurier will\nconfront a solid English speaking Gov\nernment party led by Sir Robert Borden.\nThe Prime Minister has only one French\nCanadian supporter in the house, and he\nowes his election to the vote of the Eng\nlish speaking people in the city of Ot\ntawa. So far as is known not a single\nFrench Canadian polling subdivision in\nall Canada gave a Government majority\non election day. The new alignment of\npolitical parties in Canada means there\nfore the definite .division of the people\nupon racial lines. A the racial division\nis coincident with a religious difference,\nthe delicate and dangerous aspect of this\nnew phase of Canadian political life need\nnot be enlarged upon.\nThis open division upon racial lines is\nunfortunate, but unavoidable. Undoubt\nedly its coming was hastened by the war;\nbut it is probable that this line of open\ncleavage, had to come some day. The war\ndid not cause a lack ofjmpatby between\nthe two races in Canada; it served\" only\nto reveal n division of sentiment which\nhad long existed, but which it had been\nthe object of Canadian public men to\niguore. Shams and pretences of all kinds\nhave had a liard time of it the world over\nsince August, 191-1. In Canada, as else\nwhere, people have lieen forced to recog\nnize stern and unpleasant realities. For\ndecades there has lien a festering t-ore in\nthe Ixxly politic of the Dominion. The\npolitical doctors have always refused to\nprobe that sore.\nWith professional gravity and unanim\nity they have given ponderous assurances\nthat all was well; but thinking Canadians\nhave, known belter. They have known\nthat there was a real division in Canadian\nnational sentiment, which a crisis like the\npresent would surely reveal in all its ugli\nness; and that real national unity could\nnever be obtained so long as certain condi\ntions in Canada were unchanged. They\nwere not astonished by the apathy of\nQuebec during the war; they knew that\nthe French Canadian attitude was the in\nevitable result of the environment and\neducation of the people of the minority\nrace.\n. Canada's national and olitical status\nis to-day in a state of transition. Enjoy\ning for man' years complete powers of\nself-government so far as the control of\nher own domestic affairs is concerned, she\nis nevertheless only a colony so far as the\ncontrol of external affairs is concerned.\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain\nand Ireland, which is to-day merely the\nchief of the various free common wealths\nof which the British Empire is composed,\nspeaks for the whole empire in foreign\naffairs and decides the issues of peace\nand war.\nThis system is a relic of the old colo\nnial days. In the course of the last cen\ntury the people of the Greater Britain\noverseas have achieved complete powers\nof self-government so far as purely local\naffairs are concerned, but no constitu\ntional changes have been wrought which\ngive to the overseas dominions any effec\ntive control of the common affairs of\nempire. This is a condition which cannot\nendure forever. That it has continued so\nlong has been due more to the inertia of\npublic sentiment in the dominions, to a\ndisinclination to assume the responsibil\nities of empire government, than to any\nopposition in the motherland to a sharing\nof power and responsibility.\nCanadians have been too busy of recent\nyears with the building of new transcon\ntinental railways, the opening up of vast\nnew areas for settlement, the rapid devel\nopment of Canadian resources and the de\nlightful and alluring process of growing\nrich over nijfht Jtbrqngh real, Rotate. and\ni '' '\" rt - n m\nmining booms ' to give much serious\nthought to the ultimate national destiny.\nBut for decades the English speaking\npeople of Canada have, nevertheless, been\ngroping instiuctively toward the conclu\nsion that Canada must assume her just\nshare of the burden of empire and must\n\"have her just influence in the control of\ncommon affairs.\nThere has been and there still is much\ndiversity of opinion as to the nature of\nthe constitutional changes by which these\nresults shall be brought about, but there\nhas been a general, though instinctive,\nagreement as to the direction toward which\nCanadian policy should endeavor to shape,\nthe destiny of the Dominion. This has\nbeen true of English speaking Canada, but\nfc has not been true of Quebec. -French\nCanada is still in the colonial stage of\nthought. French Canada desires no new\npowers, no new responsibilities for the\nDominion. She asks only to be left alone.\nThis attitude of mind is due- to the\nisolation of the French Canadians from\nthe thought, sentiment and progress of the\nrest of the country and indeed of this\nwhole English speaking continent. Dif\nferences of language, customs, laws, re\nligion and education have operated for\ngenerations to keep the French Canadians\na race apart. Education in Quebec is in\nthe hands of church schools, and the gen\neral result is unsatisfactory.\nThe habitant, unable to read any but\nhis own newspapers, is out of touch with\nthe progress of the age and suspicions\nof the ideals and aspirations of his Eng\nlish speaking fellow citizens. Truth to\nteH, he is living to-day in a seventeenth\ncentury atmosphere; living a decent, law\nabiding, simple life, but a life that is cen\nturies behind the spirit of the present age.\nHis viewpoint is narrow and seldom ex\ntends beyond the boundaries of his own\nparish. lie' is content to let well enough\nalone and is not concerned about the\nnecessity of constitutional changes in\nkeeping with the new dignities and im\nportance of the Canadian nation. He has\nno sympathy with the imperial0enthu\nsiasm which has so gripped the imagina\ntion of his English speaking fellow citi\nzens. His principal care is the preserva\ntion and extension of the special privi\nleges with respect to his language, his\nreligion and his system of education which\nhave been guaranteed to him by the con\nstitution of the country.\nTo defend and extend these privileges\nFrench Canada baa for many years been\nprepared to vote almost as a unit in fed\neral elections. The support of French\nCanada has meant success for the political\nparty obtaining it. Quebec has long held\nthe balance of power, and she has not\nbeen modest in her demands when setting\na price upon her solid support. She has\nhad lay and clerical leaders who have\nknown definitely what they wanted, and\ntheir programme has been an ambitious\none. English speaking Canada has been\nirritated by this situation, bat appar\nently nothing could be done about it. So\nlong as English speaking Canada con\ntinued to divide on political lines it was\ninevitable that Quebec wonld have the\nbalance of power, only natural that she\nwould exact her price, and not at all\nastonishing that the price would be fur\nther extensions of special privileges which\ntended iRill further to isolate her from the\nrest of the country. When as the inevi\ntable result of this isolation Quebec ex\nhibited during the war her utter lack of\nsympathy with the loyal viewpoint of the\nother provinces of Canada, an issue wa3\ncreated that was big enough to stfeep\naway the petty differences which had\ndivided English speaking Canada into two'\npolitical camps. The new alignment hav\ning been created by the war, it is possible\nthat there may come a bold and fearles-i\ngrappling with the greatest of all Cana\ndian problems. Only radical treatment\ncan be of permanent -avail in the cure of\nthis long festering sore in the Canadian\nbody politic\nAt the moment there is intense resent\nment in Quebec and the extremists are\ntalking wildly. Listen to Henri Bourassa,\nthe leader of the Nationalist party in Que\nbec Discussing the isolation of Quebec,\nhe said the-other day in his paper, La\nDevoir, that Union Government was not a\ncoalition to win the war, but a combina\ntion of forces to subjugate his province.\n\"This object,\" he continued, \"conceived\nin hatred and lies, has ran its normal\ncoarse. It has roused up the four million\nProtestants against everything Catholie\nand everything that is not British. It has\nrevived the distrust of two million French\nCanadians and two million five hundred\nthousand Catholics against everything\nProtestant and English. In a word, the\nalleged Union has disunited the Canadian\nnation.\n\"To the troubles of India, South Africa,\nAustralia and Ireland our 'saviors of\nthe empire' have found the means to add\nreal neiul hatred in Canada. If the\nKaiser was not too busy he most have\nsent a wireless message congratulating Sir\nRobert Borden. The Union partisans did\nmore in three months than the paid agents\nof the Kaiser could have done. This\nracial discord and interprovincial divisiom\nwill be remedied when the real Canadians,\nboth English and French, will throw down\nthe shackles of the imperialists. Hatters\nare not so bad as painted, however.\"\nDespite this sort of wild talk and the\nintroduction in the Provincial Legislature\nof Quebec of a resolution favoring with\ndrawal from confederation, there is little\ndoubt that Quebec will quietly obey the\nrequirements of the selective draft law.\nThe close of the war will bring many\nproblems to the Dominion, bat it will\nbring none greater than the centuries old\ndifficulty of the isolation of the two great\nraces of which Canada is composed.\nCanadian statesmen have always shirked\nthe problem. All have been afraid of it:\nMany have conscientiously believed that\nit were best left alone to work out its own\nsolution. That it can never do. It re\nmains to be seen whether or not any real\nattempt will be made after the war to re\nmove the barriers that make for division.\nSo long as English speaking was divided\npolitically no serious attempt at the rad\nical solution of this problem was practical\nor possible. To-day it is both practical\nand possible.

Co-operative farming in\nthe United Mates is still in the experimental phase,\nalthough it has secured a firm foothold in the\nDakotas. Farmers in other states are awaking to\nits possibilities as a solution of all their problems\nand it is slowly spreading abroad like a new gospel\ncrer the American nation.\nCo-operative farming in Canada has revolu\ntionized the farming industry. It has brought\nCanadian farmers unprecedented prosperity that is\nshared in by the landed proprietor and small\nfarmer alike. It has increased the farmer's profits.\nIt has freed him from dependence on outside\nfinancial interests and enabled him to market his\nown products. It has set him in his true place in\nthe economic scheme of the nation. It has made\nevery small farmer in Canada an active participant\nin a gigantic business whose markets are the wide\nvorld.\nThroughout their fight for independence, the\nCanadian farmers have had the unfailing support\nof the Canadian government. Canada's prosperity\nrests upon its farms and the government has not\nonly helped the farmers to help themselves but has\ndone everything possible by legislation and direct\nfinancial aid to improve farming conditions.\nThotJgh 45 per cent of Canada's population is\ncentered in towns and cities, Canada is a country\nf farmers, and its government, it may be said, is\ngovernment of the farmer, for the farmer and by\nthe farmer.\nStudents of the farming situation agree that\nwhat co-operative farming has done for Canada it\nwill do for the United States under proper leader\nship. The Canadian co-operative movement has\nbeen fortunate in its leadership from the beginning.\nIt originated in a spirit of revolt against intolerable\nconditions which were robbing the farmer of the\nrewards of his industry and inspired men of the\nhiur arose to direct its destinies through trials to\nvictory. The prophets who have led it through the\ndsrk of early struggle to the promised land number\nuch men as T. A. Crerar, Canadian Minister of\nAgriculture; George Langley, Minister of Public\nWorks of Saskatchewan; Dr. J. G. Rutherford,\nformer Dominion live stock commissioner and\nnow western representative on the Dominion Rail\nways Board ; H. W. Wood, who came from Mis\nsouri a dozen years ago and is now president of\nthe Canadian Council of Agriculture; and Cecil\nRice-Jones, president and general manager of the\nAlberta Farmers' Co-operative Company, upon\nwhose $houlders fell the executive cloak as vice\npresident and general manager of the United\nGrain Growers, when Mr. Crerar entered the gov\nernment. The co-operative movement began in Canada\neighteen years ago when a small group of farmers\naffiliated to fight the elevator interests. The Mani\ntoba Grain Growers, organized in 1902, went into\nbusiness four years later in opposition to the Win\nnipeg Grain Exchange. The United Grain Grow\ners, an amalgamation of the Manitoba and Alberta\nfarmer interests, and such subsidiary organizations\nas the United Grain Growers Securities, Limited,\nmaintained for the appraisal and sale of farm\nlands, and a score of kindred societies, today num\nber 60,000 farmer shareholders. They operate 606\nconntrj elevators and fonr great terminal elevators\n. W\"- - r a\n&t. t C .'; x. S - -\"\n3 o ikeAere\nat 1 ort William and Port Arthur. They handle\none-third of all the grain grown in western Canada.\nThe small pioneer group of farmers dealt only\nin grain. The farmers' organizations today market\nall the produce of the farm and deal in eery com\nmodity which is aa rssential of farm economy. The\nGrain Growers appraise farm land values and\nlocate and look after new settlers. They conduct a\ngrain export business with headquarters in New\nYork. They have taken up the distribution of\nfarm machinery, lumber, flour, p.nd coal. The\nvolume of this side-line business is '7,000.000 an\nnually. They handle 3,000 cars of live stock a\nyear. They do an immense business in flour and\nfeed stuffs. They have a vast timber limit in\nBritish Columbia.\nTo carry on this great business, the farmer\ncompanies maintain 1,300 employes. Their paid\nup capital is $'3,000,000 with a reserve fund of\n$2,000,000. The assets of the company are\n$'12,000,000 and they paid during the war\n$1, 000,000 in war taxes.\nThese figures tell an epic story, the awakening\nof the farmer to his true economic value, his long\nfight for recognition as a business man and his final\nvictory.\nCo-operative farming seems destined to play\nan even greater part in the future development of\nCanadian farming resources than it has in the past.\nEveryone in Canada expects the proposed Can\nadian land legislation, under which farms are to be\nsold to settlers on twenty-year terms, to people\nCanada's vast uncultivated tracts with immigrants.\nThese new settlers will share in the prosperity\nachieved by co-operative methods, and their suc\ncess will aid in attracting new waves of immigra\ntion which are to build a population that will give\nCanada its rightful rank among the Cations.\nThe Canadian government has recognized the\nadvantages of co-operation to the farmers and has\npromoted it in many other lines of farming ac\ntivity besides grain marketing. Through the help\nof the government, the wool industry has been\nplaced on a co-operative basis. The sheep men\nhid much the same conditions to contend with as\nthe grain men had. The government now furnishes\nexperts to grade the wool as it comes from the\nfarmers' shearing pens and 'markets it to the best\nadvantage without expense to the flock masters.\nPoultry men have caught the spirit of co-operation\nand likewise have won prosperity through\ngovernment aid. All over Canada fowls are being\ngraded and marketed co-operatively and egg\ncircles for the co-operative marketing of eggs have\nsprung up everywhere. The Saskatchewan gov\nernment has established killing plants at Regina\nand Saskatoon where fowls are killed, graded and\nmarketed for the farmers.\n1 ... y\nX\nI I t\n2\nr\n, - . - . .,: : -.- .

Canadian\ncattle are of high standard and there are many\npure-bred dairy herds. The Dominion should be\none of the greatest dairying countries in the world,\nbut the industry languished because of inadequate\nmarketing facilities. The government is remedy\ning this. It has built co-operative creameries\nthroughout the country which turn the milk of the\nfarmers into butter and cheese and ship the\nproducts to market. The result has been a remark\nable increase in profits and in the development of\nthe dairy business. The government system is to\noperate the creameries for a certain number of\nyears until they have been put on a flourishing\nbasis and then turn them over to the farmers.\nThe government's watchful care over its farm\ners is demonstrated in many other ways. The\ngovernment is taking active steps to improve the ,\nlivestock of the country. It has made a number of\nimportations of fine cattle, sheep and hogs which\nhave been distributed among farmers to better\nfoundation herds. It has spread abroad a doctrine\nemphasizing the value of mixed farming and has\npreached to small farmers the importance of rais\ning livestock as well as grains instead of risking\ntheir year's profits on a single crop of wheat.\nIn some of the farming regions, the government\noperates tractor plows which do the plowing for\nthe farmers and reduce the cost of cultivating the\nland and increase the acreage under cultivation.\nIt semis hundreds of agricultural experts on\nperiodical rounds to superintend farming opera\ntions and teach the farmers the lat-,t scientific\nmethods of crop rotation and soil reinforcement.\nIn every way the governt', iU.s, both provincial and\nfederal, are instil!;M- the advantages of co-operation\nand helping along the spread of the co-operative\nspirit.\nWilli government direction and financial aid,\nthe farmers everywhere arc being drawn more\nclosely together until it seems probable that some\ntime in the future all rural Canada may become on?\nI", "batch": "in_billgarrett_ver02", "title_normal": "lake county times.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86058242/1920-01-17/ed-1/seq-9.json", "place": ["Indiana--Lake--Hammond"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 72, "county": [null], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83045462/1908-06-14/ed-1/seq-72/", "subject": ["Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505", "Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Washington"], "date": "19080614", "title": "Evening star.

That happened\nin May, 1919 on the twenty-second, to be explicit\nwhen an address to the King passed the Canadian\nHouse of Commons by a vote of 96 to 43 in which His\nMajesty was asked to refrain, in future, from confer\nring any title or titular distinction upon any person\nliving in Canada. It also asked that suitable legisla\ntion be instituted in the Imperial Parliament whereby\nall hereditary titles now held by Canadians might be\ncome extinct upon the death of the present holders.\nI here was a time when knighthoods were conferred\nupon only a few persons in Canada, and then the re\ncipients were usually men to whom honors if such\nwere going round might fittingly have been granted;\nbut of late years it seemed that everyone who had made\nfew millions by fair means or by foul felt that his\nenrcer was not properly rounded out unless he could\nparade a handle to his name; and, what is more to the\npoint, he generally succeeded in his endeavors to this\nend in most cases to the great pecuniary advantage of\nthe campaign coffers of the political party in power.\n'The Contributor Knight\" is dealt with by Colonel\nAndrew T. Thompson, an Ottawa writer, in his humor\nous verses entitled: \"The Canadian Knights' Enter\ntainment,\" which were published at the time of the\ncontroversy, and which ran as follows :\nAnd now a quiet smooth-faced man\nAppears to speak his part,\nA pros'prous man of middle age,\nAnd not too big a heart.\n\"I won my title well,\" said he,\n\"I saved my country dear,\nSubscribing to election funds,\nWhen there was cause to fear\n\"Unless the boodle pot were full,\nThe other side would win,\nAnd so wipe out all vested rights,\nWhich surely were a sin.\n\"I spent my thousands lavishly,\nAnd when we won the day,\nThey handed me my knighthood, and\nThat's all I have to say.\"\nThe traffic became so notorious that a knighthood\nM almost looked upon as a badge of infamy, which\nJrfy w illustrated by the remark of a western wit\nam not'c,nS the name of an eminent Toronto scientist\nnong the names of railway, commercial and financial\n\"jU-ons in the birthday or Xcw yet,.', honor list, de-\niarc(l that he \"had alwavs believed Blank to be an\nWhen Knighthood Went to Seed\nhonest man, but his inclusion in such a list was not at\nall reassuring !\"\nColonel Thompson's verses describing the \"Railway\nKnight\" are typical of the attitude of the public gen\nerally toward those who saddled Canada with an ex\ncessive railway mileage at the expense of the public\ntreasury to their own personal enrichment. He says :\nA sterner man succeeds the last,\nA man of threat'ning mien,\nAnd masterful a leader he,\nIt's easy to be seen.\n\"Ye prate of ancestry,\" quoth he,\n\"And blood both red and blue,\nBut my descent can straight be traced\nI swear to you it's true\n\"From brave Sir Henry Morgan,\nOf buccaneers the King,\nWho swaggered through the Spanish Main,\nAnd robbed like anything.\n\"Of Spanish ships he took his toll,\nHe raided many a city,\nHis fame's kept fresh unto this day,\nIn roaring sailor ditty.\n\"The Freedom of the Seas' was his,\nFor none dare say him nay.\nHe took his tithe from anywhere,\nHis motto, 'Make them pay.'\n\"From hi hot veins my blood I draw.\nHis watchword, too, is mine.\nI love to ponder on his might,\nIn the days of Auld Lang Syne.\n\" 'From near Atlantic's .sounding wave.\nTo far Pacific's shore.'\nI've looted every treasury.\nI've gathered more and more.\n\"Until, my primacy confessed.\nThey made me a Knight,\nIn ermine's white and spotless fur,\nI'm safely now bedight.\"\nThe retirement of Sir Robert Borden from the\npremiership of Canada and the resignation of Sir Lo\nmer Gouin, premier of the province of Quebec, both of\nwhich took effect within the past year, marked the\npacing of the last of Canada's titled prime ministers.\nThe present premier is\nplain Mr. Meighen with\nthe customary designation\nof \"Honorable.\" of course\nand. unless the people\nof Canada reverse their\nideas, there will never\nagain be a Canadian prime\nminister with a handle to\nhis name.\nThere are still a number of lieutenant-governors\neach province has a lieutenant-governor as the figurative\nhead of the local government but the office of a\nCanadian lieutenant-governor is about as useful as the\ngilded knob on the top of a flag-pole.\ni ne governor-general, ot course, has a strinff of\nthe 'present incumbent being a British duke and\ntitle;\nis beyond the jurisdiction of the Canadian narHamm\nbut even so exalted a post is being assailed bv Canadian\niconoclasts and it is not improbable that iii the very\nnear future the governor-general of Canada will be a\nCanadian, appointed upon the advice of the government\nof Canada; and, unless he happens to be one of those\nalready possessing a title, he will be plain and un\nadorned. Knighthoods rnd other titular distinctions are the\ntrappings of royalty. Of late years while all titles are\nconsidered to be direct from the King it is well known\nthat the King does not confer honors without the ad\nvice of his responsible ministers any more than he per\nforms a ,y other official act without their advice: so it\nreally :omei down to a question of the honors being the\ngift of the political party in power. In the early days of\nCanadian history, titles were conferred upon the\" ad\nvice of the colonial secretary in London, but of late\nyears Canadian ministries have insisted upon being con\nsulted in the matter, and thus it had come to be that\nCanadians who were honored w ith titles really received\nthem at the hands of the prime minister of Canada.\nDen ocracy and monarchy are incompatible; and\nevery advance in the former must necessarily be at the\nexpense of the latter. Thus it is that the King's pre\nrogative has been gradually circumscribed. Even in the\nmatter of the granting of title it is seen that it is\nmerely a form, and that the real decision lies with the\nelected ministers in Canada it has been decided to do\nwithout the form.\nVery few titles were granted during the premier\nship of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who, in a debate a short\ntime before his death, declared that he would be willing\nto throw his title with the Others in a heap in the\nmarket-place m that a bonfire might be made of\nthem. It may cem strange for one who was himself\nthe recipient of a title to speak thus, but it i well\nknown that the late Liberal chieftain was really not\nin favor of titles in Canada, and had frequently stated\nthat they were not in keeping with the democratic spirit\nwhich should prevail in Canada. It is told that the first\nintimation he received of his own knighthood was upon\ntaking his place at a state banquet while in L iidon\nattending the (Jueen's jubilee when he found his place\ncard inscribed; \"Sir Wilfrid Laurier.\" He could not\nvery well then have declined.\nKnighthood may have been picturesque in feudal\ntimes; but, like everything else belonging to that age.\nit appears incongruous today.", "batch": "mimtptc_jackson_ver01", "title_normal": "dearborn independent.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/2013218776/1921-06-04/ed-1/seq-11.json", "place": ["Michigan--Wayne--Dearborn"], "page": "11"}, {"sequence": 2, "county": ["Lyon"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Monthly", "id": "/lccn/sn90060662/1903-11-01/ed-1/seq-2/", "subject": ["Icelanders--Minnesota--Newspapers.", "Icelanders.--fast--(OCoLC)fst00966645", "Lyon County (Minn.)--Newspapers.", "Minneota (Minn.)--Newspapers.", "Minnesota--Lyon County--fast--(OCoLC)fst01214821", "Minnesota--Minneota.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01237061", "Minnesota.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204560"], "city": ["Minneota"], "date": "19031101", "title": "Vi\u0301nland.

Schuyler had been instrucled bv\nCongress to establish provision atores at\nsuitable places on the Hudson river be-\nween Aibany and the Highlands, so as to\nupply such troops as were called out on\ntheir march io Canada.\nCongress on the I7lh Feb., pasaed the\nfollowing resolulions.\n\" Thst the offer made bv general Schuv-\nler to tiay at the rate of four ahillings per\nday, l'or each of the sieda hired to forward\nthe Pennsylvania and JNew Jersey lorc\nin their march to Canada, be complied\nwith: '\nThat the officer\u00e0 in the continemal ar-\ntnies be enjoinsd to use their utmost dili\ngence in preventing every kind ofplunder;\nand that ali who shall onend here.n, be\npunished according to the striclrst disci\npline: ,\nI hat the resolvea or Uongress for en-\ncouraging sutiers, to aliena the army in\nCanada, be published, with the Informa\ntion ihai hosiery, ahoes, coarse hnens,\naoap, rum, sugar, and wine, are much\nwanted there:\nThat a few artificers, such as armour-\nera, smiths, carpenters, harness-makers\nand wheelwrights, with proper persons to\nsuperintend them, he forthwith sent to\nCanada. -\nThat it be recommended to the conven\ntion of New York, that auch of the offi\ncer, who served faithfully in Canada the\nlast campaign, as are willing lo continue\nthere, he prelerred, in the new leviea of\nthe colony of New York, to others.''\nBefore resuming the account-of the\nmilitary operations ofthe Provincial army\nin Canada, we must recali to the raemory\nofour readera the fact that Congress had,\noc the 25lh January, exprcssed it desire\nihat a funeral oration should be delivered\nby Dr. Smith, in honor of th brave Mont\ngomery, and of thosa officer\u00e0 and soldiera\nwho fought and fell with him in maintain-\ning the principici of American liberty.\nThis funeral oration wai delivered on the\n19th February following; and in order to\naitend ihia oration, and outofrespect for\nthe memory of Gen. Montgomery, and thoe\nwho had fallcn with him, Congress ad-\njonrned to the next day, without proceed\ning to any other business.\nWe hall for the moment lay aside the\nproceeding of Congress in regard to the\nCanadian expedition, and will turn the at-\ntention of our readera to what waa going\non in that province. We have already\ngiven, we think, a pretty correct account\nof the most important eventa which look\nplace in Canada aince the Americana had\ninvaded it, and have taken great paini to\ngive aa accorate an account aa possible of\nthe attack on Quebec.\nThe next day, Ist Jannary, 1776, be\ngan a new year, which waato be peenliar\nly unhappy for the friend of liberty in C.\nnada. The last hope of redemption for\nthat doomed country had already vanished\nin the death of the gallant Montgomery,\nwhich wa to be sueceeded by eventi yet\nmore appal'ing to the hearta of those who\nhated British tyranny. The poor Cana\ndian were yet doomed to te the taveaof\nlUe Brhith, and in spile of their gallant\nrrsistanee to trans-ailantie oppreion they\nwere yel to nfTcr more than they had al\nready done. A with individua! o il i\nwith nationa a Irivial circumstance will\noften afleci them and lurn the scale for or\nagainst a whole people happine. '\nOn the In Jnuary, the cbromahder of\nQuebec, gai e ordera that ih cornea which\nlaid near Vres-dt-Vitl battrj'jhovld U\nbroughtinto the city, which order wa im\nmediately fuISHed, On the same day the\nbodiea of thirieen individuala were brought\nin, among rubici) were found those of capi,\nM'Pherson and of capi. Cheeseman, both\naid to general Montgomery, Thee bo\ndie were both identified. h w not tilt\nthat day that the Bfitish wer apprizedr\nthrough two American desertershat Gen.\nMontgomery was missine, nd that it wa\nappoied in the American camp that he\nwaa among rhe ilun. li waa nfortuiiate\nly too true ; after a careful examination of\nthe bodiea whwh had been brought in froa\nPres-de-Ville, the body ofthe General waa\nrecognised.\nOn the 4ih, eapt. Anderson, whor ai we-\nhave already nientioned, had Ieen killed al\nthe assault ot Sault-u-Mltlot, wa\nburied with military honour. On thi\name day General Montgomery wa also\nburied, but without any cercrnonv what-\never. It waa then on false informalion\nthat Botta, in hi history of the American\nRevolution, cay thst general CaTleton or\ndered that the body of the American Gen\neral ahould be interred with ali the amai\nmilitary honors. Botta makfa thi the\nbase ora grand eulogiuni of the ublime\ngenerosity and noble eenlimenta which\nacluated the Goveroor af Canada.

S. Hurt\nby Unfortunate Phrase.\n(By Herbert Corey)\nMontreal, Au^. 12.?Canada is\n^ much like a self respecting\ncting hen. She is perfectly content\nher eggs and she does not want\nto be bothered. Interference would\nbe no more welcome from John Bull\nthan if it came from Uncle Sam.\n\"There was a sentiment for a\nnearer relation to the United States,\nbut youk illed it by one phrase,\" and\none of Canada's foremost men*\n\"What was the phrase?\" I\n\"We won the war.\"\nI am not permitted to quote the\nspeaker by name, but he has much\n(to do with the shaping of Canadian\nthought. He said that when the war\nended Canada was rather sick of\nGreat Britain and the continent of\nEurope. Canadians are Americans.\nThose who live on the other side\nthing differently and more selfishly.\nThey are expert at preaching and\nphrasing.\n\"An American editor came in to\nsee me,\" he chuckled. \"He said that\nno nation ever fougj^ with loftier or\nmore unselfish motives than Great\nBritain. But by an odd chance every\nloose thing in the world stuck to her\nfingers.\"\nHe said the caste system of Eu~\nrope and Great Britain repelled the\nCanadians, too. And there was the\nreflex action of the Canadians on the\ncast.' system to be considered. Born\nand bred aristocrats did not love\nbom and bred democrats. The Cana\nHian troops who were first over\nthought undisciplined by the English\nofficers. They themselves might\nacknowledge they were wild and\nwool y and hard to curry.\n\"They became excellently disciplined\nsoldiers,\" said the gentleman\nquoted, \"largely through the efforts\nof Gt-aeral Curry. He made the Canadian\nsee that they were not good\nsoldieis unit s they obeyed orders to\nthe letter. At the end of the war the\nCanadians were regarded as very\ncocky troops. They tell a story of a\nbattle between the Australian and\nCanadian troops in an English village.\nIt lasted for two days and during\nthat time the officers dared not\ngo near. The men used only their\nfists.\n* '\"At the height of th? fight a newly\narrived Australian officer, at the\nvillage, walked past a barracks in\nwhich a terrific battle was on.

He rose to\nhis feet, recognized an officer, clicked\nhis heals, snapped a salute?and\nthen dived through the nearest, uoo.\ninto the fight again.\"'\nAt the end*of the war the Canadians\nand the men from the United\nStates had become good friends.\nThey were alike willing to avoid\nparticipation in another European\nwar.\n\"Never again,\" wa% the vow of\nthe common soldier.\n| Just as conditions had ripened for\na much better understanding between\nCanada and the United States\n1?if for nothing else?we Yankees\nkilled the chance, said the Canadian\nquoted, the one phrase did it?\"We\nI won the war.\" Canada had suffered\ni heavily in men and money. The Unitled\nStates, he said, had actually been\nI a gainer by the war, as compared\niwith the rest of the world. The Canadians\nwere enraged by what they\nI believed to be Yankee swank.\n\"We did as much as the Yanks\nourselves,\" they used to say. \"But\nwe do not say that \"We won the\nwar.\"\nThe speaker went on to say that\nmost Canadians realize that Americans\ndo not mean \"We won the war\"\nI just as it sounds. \"We know that\n| you understand that a combination\n! of many factors won the war. You\nare one factor and we are another\nand France another and so on. But\nthe fact remains that the feeling\naroused in Canada against Americans\nby that unfortunate phrase has\nput an end to any demand for a\ncloser union?of any sort?at present.\"\nWhat Canada appears to want?\nI and to be in a fair way to get?is a\ngreater degree of independence than\nshe has ever had before. The gentleman\nquoted is by reason of his position\nacquainted with the various cur;\nrents in Canada. A more authoritative\ninterpreter of Canadian thoughl\ncould not be found, perhaps. He says\nthat Canada would welcome any ta\n1 riff change which might promise t<\nbe beneficial Ce.nada as well as t<\nthe United stu**.-.\n\"We allow certain British good:\na small preferential\" he said. \"But\nthat is not because of any feeling\nfor the British manufacturer,\nbc-u :se he sells goo cbeape- that\nv.e would get them othov.:?*.

Canadians, hesaid, are _\n, perfectly willing that Canada shall\n' remain a part of the British empire\ni for the protection and other benefits\nshe may gain thereby, but the authority\nof London over Canada will\nnever be increased. There is a widespread\nCanadian doubt as to the\nmotives of some British politicians\nand a decided disinclination to per-1\nmit Canada to be exploited for the\nbenefit of England.\n\"That is why we find it difficult to\nunderstand your Mr. Taft,\" said the ,\nspeaker, \"when he says that Great\nBritain will have five votes in ffte\nleague of nations. England will have\none, and Canada one, and so on.\"\n\"In America we think that the\nBritishers would stick together,\" he\nwas reminded.\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said he. \"It is\nmore likely that Canadian interests\nwould jump with those of the United\nStates than with those of England.'*\nCanada has been independent?\nfor all practical purposes?for a long\ntime, he said. \"We have a governor\ngeneral, appointed from England,\nit is trye. But that system has its\nadvantages. We could not get together\non a Canadian for this appointment.\nAnyhow, the governor general\nhas no authority. He does what I\nhe is told to do. If he' tried to inter- I\nfere with parliament?well, the same I\nthing would happen to him that I\nwould happen to King George if he |\ntried to interfere.\"\nThere is still another reason why\nCanada does not desire a closer political\nunion with the United States,\nhe said. Canadians are well informed\non matters south of the line through\ntheir newspapers, though few papers\nin the states make a specialty of\nCanadian news. That defect is to be\ncorrected, he hoped, through the establishment\nof a news distributing\nsendee in the United States.\n\"But we read our papers.\" said he,\n\"and study your public men through\nI the medium of their speeches.

E. O'Mera.\nWISH to speak for a few moments\non some points of contact between\nthe United States and Canada in res\npect to the Indian. For we have the\nsame great general problems to deal\nwith\u2014health, education, industry,\nComing to the Yukon territory, we\nhave there conditions very similar to\nt]hose you have in Alaska. We have\nin that vast territory many scattered\nbands of Indians, living at immense\ndistances from one another, and some\nof them in such remote parts of ter\nritory and with such difficulties of\ntravel that they seem almost inac\ncessible. We have these Indians\ncoming and trading at various trad\ninga forts established at centers up\non the Yukon river, and also in vari\nous remote parts of the territory.\nWe have been negotiating with the\ngovernment of the Dominion on be\nhalf of the Yukon Indians, endeavor\ning to obtain for them the utmost\npossible \"benefits, and we wish to\npromote especially the matter of\nmedical help. We are strenuously\nendeavoring to secure more of such\nhelp for the Yukon Indians and hope\nbefore long to secure a medical man\nA LIGHT. 27.\nwho will devote his whole time to the\nwelfare of those people. In these ef\nforts we have made along the line Of\neducation and medical help, as well\nas in other directions, we have come\nto one fundamental question, and\nthat is: Have th6 Indians any rights\nwhich the government should re\ncognize? And we find that the deci\nsion of that question will affect what\nis to be done for the Indians in all\nthese matters. We have been basing\nour efforts upon the princiqal of com\npensation, and we find that, that prin\ncipal has been acted upon to a very\nlarge extent by the United States, by\nGreat Britain, and also by the\ngovernment of Canada.\nBut I come now to say a few words\nabout one great part of Canada, which\nstands as a notable exception to the\napplication of that principal, namely\nthe province of British Columbia,\ncontaining about 25,000 Indians. The\nsituation that faces us in that pro\nvince today is very strikingly simi\nlar to that which faces you in the\nstate of California, about which you\nhave heard this morning.\nLet me give you a very brief out\nline of that situation. Between the\nyears 1850 and 1860 several treaties\nwere made with bands of Indians,\nunder which their rights to the land\nwas fully recognized, and certain\nsmall parcels of land on Vancouver\nIsland were pnrchased from them.\nBetween the years 1860 and 1870 the\ngovernment of the then colony of\nBritish Columbia adopted the view\nthat whatever they did for the Indi\nans was a mere matter of favor and\nof policy not founded upon any right\nof the Indians in the land.

No Indian\nin Canada can come forward and say\nthat his land has been taken from him\nwithout his full consent. Another\ncause for the absence of trouble is that\nthe purpose of the Department seems\nto be to keep the Indians contented\nand satisfied with their lot as Indians.\nAlthough the original idea was amal\ngamation, the principle has not been\ncarried out to any extent. Instead of\ngradually removing the class barriers\nas we have been doing, through the\nland-in severalty idea, Canada has\nadopted the other extreme, and the\nsystem of paternalism now existing\nthere has been developed to such an\nextent that the Indian is tied hand\nand foot, with an endless amount of\nred tape. He is looked on, apparently,\nas a permanent institution of the\nDominion, and every inducement is\nheld out to have him remain an Indi\nan. It is true that there is an enfran\nchisement law, but it is cumbersome\nand wholly inadequate. This can be\nbetter appreciated when it is noted\nthat although the law has been in\nforce for years, the entire records of\nthe Indian Office probably would not\n4'\nY\nW?1*,-' *V'~ *i\nTHE OGLALA LIGHT. 17.\nW^f'\nV. fc\u00bb\nshow two hundred Indians who have\nbecome citizens of the Dominion.\nIn short, the main' purpose of the\nGovernment, as expressed over a\ncentury ago, to do away with a dis\ntinct class of people by process of\nassimilation, has been entirely lost\nsight of.

In view of the\nrapid changes made by selling Indian\nlands, the abolishment of nonreserva\ntion schools, etc., it behooves our in\nfluential Indians to use every endeav\nor to help their people to positious of\nself maintenance. The hands on the\nclock rapidly approach the hour when\nevery Indian must stand alone. He\nwill have to earn all he eats and wears.\nHe must pay for the education of\nhis children, as well as work to feed\nthem. He must be taught to find the\nroads to results which encounter the\nleast resistance, and that can alone be\ntaught by an enlargement of mental\nvision and industrial education.

In the majority of the pro\nvinces physical training, including the military drill, is a prescribed\nsubject in all primary schools. Besides this, there is the Strathcona\nfund. This is a fund of $500,000, bequeathed by Lord Strathcona,\nfor the purpose of promoting physical culture, military training and\nrifle practice in the schools of Canada. The interest from the fund\nis annually divided among various local committees throughout Can\nada which distribute it among the provinces. Under these two pro\nvisions Canada has greatly promoted its military efficiency, as has\nbeen demonstrated only recently in Europe.\nIn France military training has been part of the curricula of the\npublic schools ever since shortly after the Franco-Prussian war. The\nreport of the Bureau of Education says that the school battalions\nwere composed of boys over 12 years of age, whose fitness for re\nceiving military instruction had been attested by a commission con\nsisting of two officers designated by military authorities and a school\ninspector.\nGermany was the first nation to establish universal military service.\nPrussia started it in 1814, and the other German states soon followed\nsuit, thus laying a firm foundation for the present day militarism.\nPrior to this Germany had instituted courses of military training in\nthe public schools, but after the Napoleonic wars the nation began\nsuch rigorous courses of preparedness for all males that the school\ncourses were no longer considered necessary.\n13.", "batch": "sdhi_jamaica_ver01", "title_normal": "oglala light.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/2017270500/1917-11-01/ed-1/seq-17.json", "place": ["South Dakota--Shannon County--Pine Ridge"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 141, "county": [null], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83045462/1951-12-16/ed-1/seq-141/", "subject": ["Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505", "Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Washington"], "date": "19511216", "title": "Evening star.

While I can hope\nto add but little to what has already\nbecome a matter of general knowl\nedge, through the medium of current\npublications, I have chosen this sub\nject in the hope that I might be able\nto bring to your attention some facts\nconcerning that country\u2019with which\nyou are not now familiar.\nThe worth of a country and its\nnational nations\nof the world are judged largely by its\ngeneral prosperity. It was the pros\nperity of Canada that during the\npast few years attracted the attention\nof the entire world. I say during\nthe past few years, because, previous\nto that time, Canada made very lit\ntle progress as a nation. Not that\nthe country lacked in possibilities,\nthe hand of Nature never more gen\nerously endowed a nation, but simply\nbecause these possibilities were so\nlittle recognized and appreciated.\nEastern Canada today is to a large\nextent the Eastern Canada ef fifty\nyears ago. Practically the only de\nvelopment the country has known\nin xecent years rightfully belongs to\nWestern Canada, consequently I\nshall be content in addressing my re\nmarks chiefly to that part of the\ncountry.\nThat part of Canada commonly\nknown as the Canadian Northwest\ncomprises chiefly that section of the\ncountry extending from the Interna\ntional boundary on the south to the\n\u25a06oth parallel of latitude on the north;\nand from the Province of Ontario\non the east to the Rocky Mountains\non the west. It includes Saskatch\newan, Manitoba and Alberta, with\nAssiniboia and Athabasca, making\nin all an aggregate territory of 588,-\n876 square miles \u2014no small item for\nconsideration. It is this vast region,\nso fertil and productive, so rich in\nnatural resources so renowned for\nits wheat growing, that the Dominion\nGovernment has for nearly half a\ncentury flunted in the face of the\nworld in an effort to attract the at\ntention of homeseekers.\nThirty years ago the country west\ncf Winnipeg was a barren waste. It\nwas about that time that the C. P. R.\nwas built. The country was then\nlooked upon as worthless. The pos\nsibilities that recent years have de\nveloped were recognized by few.\nFor many years the railroad and\nGovernment united in an effort to\ninduce settlers to take up the land\nand develop the natural resources of\nthe country. It was only during\nthe past few years that the efforts\nhave met with any success. Elbert\nHubbard, in a recent issue of the\nFra, covers this phase of the ques\ntion so attractively that I can do no\nbetter than quote his words. He\nsays: \u201cI first visited Winnipeg\ntwenty years ago. It was shortly\nafter the opening of the C. P. R. and\nI saw the marvel of three trains a\nday being sent westward, loaded\nwith emigrants. \u2018How long,\u2019 said I,\n\u2018can this keep up?\u2019 Last month I\nsaw exactly the same sight, only\nwith more emigrants and better train\nservice. \u2018We have kept it up ever\n\u2022k t\nm\nBy Young Steady.\nSTILLWATER, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, MARCH, 2, 1911.\nsince,\u2019 said the man who took twenty\nyears to answer my question.\u201d\nAnd this constant stream of human\nfreight, extending over a period of\ntwenty years, what has it done for\nCanada? We first note an increase\nin her population of over 5,000,000\npeople during that time, most of\nwhom found homes in the west. Un\nfortunately for Canada and Canadian\nprosperity, the Government has ex\nercised too little care in the past in\nthe selection of emigrants. It re\ncognized only the need of men to\ncultivate and till the soil. As this\nneed could not be supplied on this\nside of the Atlantic, it invaded the\nOld World. From the over-crowded\ncountries of Europe only the most\nshiftless and undesirable were\ntempted by the offers of free land\nand assistance made by the Govern\nment. In 1902-3 several thousands\nDoukhobors, from southern Russia\nwere transported to Canada. Each\nwas given a grant of free land and\nsuch other assistance as they needed.\nThey came as wards of the Govern\nment and have ever remained as use\nless and expensive charges.\nCanada still continued to hold her\narms open to the world. To each\nhomeseeker she offered 160 acres\nof free land and the civil equalities\nwhich Canadian citizenship assures.\nDuring the last few years a far bet\nter element has invaded Western\nCanada. Up to the end of the year\n1909 over 14,000,000 acres of free\nland were taken up by people from\nthe United States alone. During\nthe same year more than 40,000 new\nhomes were reared on the prairie\nprovinces. The worth of this class\nand the honesty of their intentions\nare vouched for by the fact that a\ncareful estimate shows that no less\nthan $75,000,000 of American money\nand personal effects passed through\nthe gates of the Emigration Depart\nment in 1909 alone.\nThese facts have caused the U. S.\nGovernment some anxiety during the\npast year. A broad and compre\nhensive view of the matter does not\nseem to disclose any reasonable\ngrounds for apprehension. Consid\nering the wonderful future of Can\nada, which the present outlook as\nsures, one can not but conclude that\na much closer relation must exist be\ntween the two countries in the fu\nture. Canada is destined to become\na world power. There is no nation\non earth more richly endowed. Its\narea is greater than that of the United\nStates. In Western Canada alone\nthere are over 334,000,000 acres of\ntillable soil, of which but 44,000,000\nacres are homesteaded. In the year\n1909, the 12,000,000 acres under the\nplow yielded a crop valued at $532,-\n000,000. If the time ever comes\n\u2014and come it surely will within the\nnext few decades \u2014when the entire\nportion of that vast country is re\nduced to a state of production, Can\nada will be in a position to yield four\nand a half billion bushels of wheat\nannually, or one billion bushels in\nexcess of the entire world\u2019s output\nfor 1909. When that time comes\nthe United States is certain to profit\nby their close relation. The time is\nlimited when this country will be\nable to take care of its ever-increas\ning population. It is sure to feel\nIT IS NEVER TOO DARK TO SMILE. .\nthe need of such products as Canada\nis in a position to produce in no dis\ntant future.\nMoreover, there is every reason\nwhy Canada should court a closer\nrelation with the people of this coun\ntry. There are no more progressive\nor desirable people on earth than\nthe American people, and no coun\ntry more in need of such men as\nAmerica produces than Canada.\nCanada, and Canadian citizenship,\noffer Americans the same privileges,\nin the same full measure of freedom,\nthat they enjoy in this country.\nThere they find a government as free\nas any republic; a climate well suited\nfor all branches of agricultural pur\nsuits and a social condition second to\nnone in the world. Canadian citi\nzenship may be established by three\nyear\u2019s residence and all who take up\nland enjoy the rights of citizenship\nfrom the date of occupancy.\n_____ \u2713\nWherever this subject is intro\nduced there is always cited as the\nchief objection t o the Canadian\nNorthwest, the severity of the win\nters in that section of the country.\nYears ago, poet Kippling set the\nworld ringing with his famous ode\nto The Lady of The Snows; today,\nthe belief is so generally accepted\nthat even the children have come to\nregard the country with chilly\ndistrust. That the Canadian win\nters are long and severe no one in\nthe least familiar with the country\nwill deny; that they are sufficiently\nso to interfere with the progress of\nthe country is an illusion. Anyone\notherwise prepared to meet the con\nditions of frontier life will encounter\nno difficulty in this respect in his ef\nfort to establish a home in the new\nwest.\nAnd if the winters are long and\nsevere. Nature has full compensated\nthat country with summers so favor\nable to all manner of agricultural\npursuits as to make it the most pro\nductive of nations.\nAlthough suited for all branches\nof farming, the chief crop of West\nern Canada is wheat. The yield of\nthis particular grain during the past\nfive years, with the possible excep\ntion of 1910, is shown to be remark\nably large. The excellency of this\nwheat is assured by the fact that it\ncommands the highest market price.\nMost of the Canadian wheat finds a\nforeign market. Millions of bushels\nare exported to England every year,\nby way of Montreal and thence to\nLiverpool. With the comoletion of\nthe new Hudson Bay railway, now in\ncourse of construction, a shorter and\nmore direct route will be established\nbetween the field of production and\nthe markets of the old world. This\nroad, which will have it terminus at\nFort Churchill, on the Hudson, will\nbe owned and operated by the Do\nminion Government, as will also the\nelevators at Fort Churchill harbor.\nThis will open up practically the\nentire portion of Western Canada,\nincluding over 200,000,000 acres\nnorth of the boundary of Alberta\nand Saskatchewan, the real value of\nwhich is unknown.\nThe mines of Western Canada\nhave lately attracted the attention of\nmany enterprisipg Americans and\nfurnished profitable investment for\nmillions of dollars of American cap\nital. There are to be found in great\nabundance gold* silver, nickel and\ncoal, while the iron deposits of that\ncountry are said to be the richest in\nG ncludyl on page 4.\n1\nThe theatrical season, I learn is devoid of sensation. The show\nworld is reduced to discussing the two old stock questions: Why all the\nmen marry Lillian Russell and the women, Nat. Goodwin.

Kelley. Ro\nman Catholic bishop of Okla\nhoma City and Tulsa, has just\nmade a visit to Quebec Province.\nFollowing is his second of two\narticles.\nBy BISHOr FRANCIS C. KELLEY.\nQUEBEC fN.A.N.A.l\u2014A hard and\nfast French - Canadian national\nist said to me: \u201cThe Boer War\ncalled us and we went. We sus\npected it to be an unjust war against\na free people and purely for English\naggrandizement. That was what\nit turned out to be and most Eng\nlishmen now know it. We went to\nwar again against the Kaiser, but\nmuch more cheerfully because it\nwas for the Empire.\n\u201cNow we are asked again but,\nmark this well, though the cause\nIs just and we know it, it means that\na chain is being fastened on Canada\nfor as long as she remains in the\nempire. Must we go into every war.\ngreat or small, that Great Britain\nwages? If so\u2014adieu to our dream\nof nationhood.\n\u201cWe voted against conscription to\nShow that we hold Canada to be a j\nfree country. We had no other\nmeans of expressing our mind on\nthe subject; no other way to guard\nour liberties in the Canadian na\ntion. Some day our English\nCanadian fellow citizens will see\nthat and perhaps be grateful.\u201d\nA minority of English-Canadians\nUnderstands. In all lovaltv to the\nDominion they agreed with Prof.\nScott of McGill University when\nhe wrote: \u201cThe French-Canadians\nmean what they say when thev say\nthey will do everything necessary\nfor the defense of Canada. They\nhave already accepted conscription\nof manpower for this purpose, and\nthey do not mind whether this\nmeans going to Alaska, Greenland\nor Panama.\nFrench Die for Empire.\n\"It is a good deal farther from\nQuebec city to Alaska than from\nQuebec city to London. Why the\ndifference in attitude toward com\npulsory service in the two places?\nSolely because service across the\nAtlantic represents the imperialist\ntie. and looks like defense of the\nBritish Empire rather than defense\nof Canada or Canadian interests.\n... All that Quebec means by the\n\u2018no\u2019 vote is that she does not wish\nher children to die for any country\nother than their own. This is\nnothing very startling.\u201d Yet many\nFrench have already died for the\nEmpire in this war.\nThere 'can be no doubt but that\nthe ideals of the fathers of con\nfederation agree with Dr. Scott's.\nHe quotes freely from about all the\nleaders: MacDonald, Tupper pr.d\nHaviland. as well as Largcvin end\nCartier. Even Lord Monck wrote to\nMacDonald: \u2018\u2018To you and your col\nleagues is really due the honor of\nhaving founded a great nation.\u201d\nCartier said to the English: \"We\nwere of different races, not for the\npurpose of warring against each\nother but in order to compete and j\nemulate for the general welfare.\" I\nThere were those in the Charlotte\ntown and Quebec conferences who\nspoke of the kingdom of Canada,\nand wanted the English King to be\nCanada's king. It was consideration\nfor the close neighborhood of the\nAmerican republic that, in part at\nleast, made them accept a lesser\ntitle. \\\nBut let us not think that the Ca\nnadians were merely imitating us.\nThey never, English or French,\nthought of cutting the bond with\nGreat Britain. One reason for con- 1\niruerauon was ro save tne north\nwest to Canada. We Americans were\ndriving through our first transconti\nnental railways then. Canada had\nto watch us. This she could not do\neffectively under colonial status.\nHad to Unite to Build.\nCanada had to unite to build\nBut site was thus not only saving\nher present but insuring her future\nand guarding her western territorial\ntrade interests. She could not de\npend for a market on free-trade\nGreat Britain. The corn laws had\nkilled that market, for the haul was\ntoo long for successful competition\nwith nearer producers. Some Eng\nlish-Canadians even suggested an\nnexation to the United States and\nsigned a petition for it. But only a\nhandful of French (four) could be\ngotten to join with them. In the\nWar of 1812 the French defended\nCanada against us. They would ac\ncept. neither annexation nor colony\nstatus. Brittania might go on rul\ning the waves as long as she could,\nso far as French-Canada was con\ncerned, but she must not try too\nhard to rule the Laurentides and tha\nRockies.\n\u2018\u2018Why pick us out as disloyal be\ncause we stand on the principle\nthat- conscription would kill our na\ntion?\" asked my hard-and-fast na\ntionalist. \u2018\u2018Why not pick on South\nAfrica, Australia, or Northern Ire\nland? They have no conscription\nfor foreign service in any of them.\"\nWhen he said \u2018\u2018Northern Ireland\"\nhe smiled\u2014significantly. I remem\nbered that he had presented me\nwith a booklet proving that William\nof Orange spoke bad English but\nspoke and wrote excellent French\nand that he actually had subsidized\nthe Catholic missionary and dis\ncoverer, Father Hennepin.\nIt's hard to find funny stories in\nFrench-Canada. but of humor\u2014ah!\nThat is different and always in\ngreat store. He quoted Lord\nTweedsmuir. late governor general\nof Canada, who said in 1937: \"Can\nI 1\nWe do the eomplete job without any\nInconvenience to you and allow 3ft\nmonths for payment. Free survey with\nno obliration.\n%\n' ada is a sovereign nation and can\nnot take her attitude to the world\ndocilely from Britain, or from the\nUnited States, or from anybody\nelse. A Canadian's first loyalty is\nnot to the British commonwealth\nof nations but to Canada and to\nCanada's king, and those who deny\nthis are doing, to my mind, a great\ndisservice to the commonwealth.\"\nHe might even have said: \"To the\nempire.\"\nAncient Quebec Is Tourist Lure.\nHow stop the two tongues of Can\nada from scolding each other? A\nbishop answered: \"Generosity. All\nof us are children, French-Cana\ndians included. Children like candy.\nThe English have most of it. Let\nthem begin to share it a little with\nus. The French will then contribute\nenough maple sugar to make more\nand better candy for both. Let us\nsit down together under the maple\ntrees in the sugar grove, drop eggs\ninto the fresh sirup and enjoy them\ntogether.\u201d He was a diplomat, that\nman.\nA business leader was more prac\ntical: \"The English think our con\ntribution to Canada's financial wel\n' \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\u2014\u2014-- --1 - ___\nfare is small compared to theirs.\nBut English-Canada does not realize\nhow great is our contribution. How\nabout the 30 or so millions of dollars\nper annum that Canada receives\nfrom tourists? Quebec is the mag\nnet that draws it here. What\nYankee wants to come here to see\nfactories in Ontario when he has\nbigger and better factories to ad\nmire at home? Quebec may have\nan ancient appearance to modem\neyes, out it is the ancient things\nthe Yankee visitor comes for. Que\nbec is Deauty, romance, history and\nreligion.\n\u201cOntario may keep the counting\nhouse; Quebec will be satisfied with\nthe shrine. The tourist wants some\nthing different from what he has\nat home: we are proudly different.\nBut our being different pays Canada\nwell\n\"The English own the steamships\nand railroads and get the financial\nprofit of them We get the satis\nfaction of knowing that our way of\nlife is attractive enough to draw\npeople here to see and admire it.\nWe've got something: something we\nwon\u2019t give up\u2014ever. But it is worth\na lot to a united Canada. The price\nof our contribution is only fair play\nand the equality that we were prom\nised.\"\nLanguage Study Urged.\nIf Canada had an enemy to watch,\nthe two peoples might get together\nand stay together; but Canada has\nno enemy. The United States is\nthe only possibility of that kind in\nsight and the United States of\nAmerica is Canada's friend, proud\nof an unfortified continent-long\nfrontier. We cannot conceive of\nour playing an enemy role to Can\nada. There was (past tense to be\nwell noted* Japan, but we are tak\ning care of Japan. An enemy to j\nwatch might be an unappreciated\nblessing in disguise for Canada. In\ndefault of one, she will have to find\na way of peace in order to live with\nherself: Equal partnership and cor\ndial appreciation, each for the other,\nof the virtues of her two peoples.\nIt would do all kinds of good for\nthe French intelligentsia to learn\nmore English and the English in\ntelligentsia to learn more French.\nThat remedy is beginning to be\nemployed. Both Laval and Mon\ntreal, the large French universities,\nhave developed summer language\ncourses in English. They are suc\ncesses: made so by the number of\nEnglish-Canadians who come to\nfollow them. More and more young\nFrench-speaking students go away\nto learn English. I met faculty\nmembers of both Laval and its af\nfiliated colleges who were alumni of\nthe Catholic University at Wash\nington and of Harvard. It w^as not\nlike that 50 years ago when I\nstudied in Quebec.\nDr. Scott, already referred to, is\nthe son of the distinguished Angli\ncan Archdeacon Scott.

J. White, of the\nDepartment of the Interior.\nOttawa, Canada.)\nI \u25a0 trolled into a bank In one of the\nolties of the west a abort time ago and\nthe bank manager said \"after the\nwar. the Canadians should be pre\npared for a great influx of people.\nThe crops that the western Canadian\nfarms have produced in 1915, and the\nwealth that the fanners have had\nthrust upon them by the high price\nof grain, will make farm lauds valu\nable and farming remunerative. After\nthe war is over there will be thou\nsands go to Canada to engage in agri\nculture and many other Industries that\nwill certainly prove profitable. Condi\ntions will be wonderfully good. The\nadvertising that Canada has had dur\ning the last year or two by its magnifl*\ncent contribution of over 250,000 men\nto fight for the Empire, the wonderful\nsums it has given to the Red Cross\nand Patriotic funds, the excellent\nshowing it made in subscribing over\ndouble when only 60 millions of dollars\nwas asked as a war loan, the brav\nery, courage and hardihood of the sol\ndiers who have fought the battles In\nFlanders, it is just wonderful.\" and\nmy enthusiastic banker grew eloquent.\nOne might have thought he was a sub\nsidised booster for Canada. \u201cBut,\" he\nsaid \u201cthey won't go until after the\nwar.\u201d *\n\u201cWell, now, Mr. -\u2014, why wait un\ntil after the war? If all you say be\ntrue, and you have said nothing yet\nof the wonderful bank clearings of\nCanada today, nothing of the fact that\nthe immense grain crop of Western\nCanada this year has given to every\nman, woman and child in that coun\ntry, over three hundred dollars per\nhead, why wait until after the war?\nAfter the war, under such conditions\nas you have pictured (and which are\nreal) land values will go up, prices\nwill increase. Advantage should be\ntaken of the low prices at which these\nagricultural lands can be had today.\nThey have not Increased any as yet,\nmd excellent farm lands can be had\nclose to railways in old settlements,\n>n excellent communities for from fif\nteen to thirty dollars per acre. The\nclimate la good and will be no better\nafter the war.\"\n\u201cWhat about conscription, though?\nIs there not a danger from conscrip\ntion, and should I advise any to go\nthere now, would they not have to\nface It? Then too, there is the report\nthat there Is a heavy war tax on\nlands.\"\nI was surprised to learn that these\nold yarns, stories that I thought had\nbeen exploded long ago, were still do\ning duty in many parts of the United\nStates, and that a gentleman of the\nwide learning of my friend, was in\nclined to believe them.\n\u201cConscription!\" I said. \u201cWith Can\nada contributing 250,000 men voluntari\nly enlisted, why conscription? There\nis no conscription in Canada, and\nneither will there be. It Is not need\ned. In any case no legislation could\nbe passed by the Dominion Parliament\nwhich would Impose military service\nupon people who are not citizens of\nCanada, cither by birth or naturaliza\ntion. Settlers from the United States\ncould not become naturalized British\nSubjects until they had resided In\nCanada continuously for three years.\u201d\n( quoted from official documents.\n\u201cIn the first few months of the war\nI clearly stated that there would not\nbe conscription In Canada. I repeat\nthat statement today.\"\n\u201cAnd then to I continued,\nquoting again from official authority.\n\u201cAll taxes levied by the Federal Gov\nernment take the Indirect form of cus\ntoms excise and Inland revenue du\nties. It Is untrue that farmers are\npaying direct war-tax levies and no\nIntending settler need hesitate to\ncome to Canada on this account.\n\"Official denials should convince you\nthat all apprehensions which have\nbeen making some would-be-settlers\nfrom the United States hesitate to\nmake a change while the war lasts\nare without foundation. With these\nmisunderstandings cleared up, the\npresent war conditions even become\nan added inducement to settlement in\nany part of the provinces of western\nCanada. Inasmuch as war prices and\nkeen demands for all manner of farm\nproducts afford tho farmer a special\nopportunity to make money.\u201d\nI was glad of the chance and\npleased to have him state that his\nviews had altogether changed.\nI could have continued, and told him\nof the fortunes that had been made in\nthe season of 1916, out of farming,\nwheat growing, oat growing, barley\ngrowing, cattle raising, dairying and\nmixed farming. I could have told\nhim of an Ottawa (Canada) syndicate\nthat bad a yield of 130 bushels of\noats per acre from their farm at Waln\nwright and from 60 acres of wheat\nfield they threshed over 60 bushels per\nacre. These yields while phenomenal,\nwere repeated in many portions of\nwestern Canada. It was Interesting to\nInform him that the average yield of\nspring wheat In Saskatchewan was\n25.16 bushels per acre; Manitoba, 36.3\nbushels; in Alberta, 36.16 bushels,\nand over the three provinces there was\na total averago of over 30 bushels per\nacre.\n\u201cTho Immense crop that has Ju\u00dft\nbeen harvested has put millions of dol\nlars in the hands of the fanners, and\nthe work of distribution through the\nregular channels of trade has already\nbegun. Millions of bushels of grain\nare still In tho hands of the farmers,\nwhich means that there Is a vast store\nof realizable wealth that will be stead\nily going into circulation, benefltting\nthe thousands who are dependent In\ndirectly on the basic Industry of the\nprovince for their livelihood.\n\u201cThe mock prosperity that rested on\nthe insecure foundation of inflated real\nestate values has passed away, and in\nits place the corner stone of the coun\ntry's sound financial future is being\nbuilt.\n\u201cThe trust and mortgage companies,\nthe large implement concerns and the\nwholesale merchants all tell tho same\nstory today of marked Improvement\nIn their business. Tho farmers and\nothers are meeting their Just dues and\npaying off debts that in many cases\nhave been long overdue. Collections\nare better today than they have been\nsince the most prosperous days of our\nhistory, and obligations are being met\nfreely and promptly.\n\u201cNow,\" I said, \u201cwhy should they\nwait until the war is over?\"\nAnd he agreed with me.\u2014Advertise\nment.\nThe Laugh That Failed.\n\u201cLaugh, and tho world laughs wjth\nyou,\u201d quoted the humorist with tho un\nbarbered hair, as he handed the editor\nan alleged Joke oT the Joe Millar vin\ntage.\n\"Yes,\" replied the editor.

S. and Canada\nDominion's Economy\nIs Already Closely\nGeared to Ours\nBy OLIVER McKEE.\nCloser trade and economic rela\ntions between United States and\nCanada are likely to result from the\nplans for co-operation in defense,\nDepartment of Commerce experts\npredicted today.\nLike the United States, Canada\nwill lose most of her export market\nIn Europe if the axis powers win\nthe war and established a closed\neconomy on the continent.\nCanada's economy already is\nclosely geared to that of the United\nStates. The two countries usually\nshare prosperity and hard times\ntogether. If business in this country\ncontinues to improve, the United\nStates is likely to increase its pur\nchases of Canadian products.\nCanada's war effort, now large, is\nexpected to expand still further, as\nBritain mobilizes the resources of\nthe empire in the battle against the\naxis powers. In the expansion,\nCanada may need financial assist\nance from the United States and\nIt Is believed this question will be\nstudied as an aftermath of the de\nfense agreement between the two\ncountries. The possibilities of\nstandardizing tanks, trucks, and\nother defense supplies manufactured\nIn the two countries may also be\nconsidered.\nDirector James W. Young of the\nBureau of Foreign and Domestic\nCommerce reported today that em\nployment in Canada, due to the\nlarge war orders on hand, had\nreached a new high level. Since the\nwar, Canada has been buying much\nlarger quantities of American goods.\nDuring the 10-month period ending\nin June. Canada's Imports from the\nUnited States were valued at $496,\n000,000, as compared with $333,\n000,000 for the corresponding period\nIn 1938-1939.\nWar Materials Large Item.\nWar materials bulk large in the\nincreased shipments from the United\nStates. In addition to aircraft,\nCanada has stepped up its purchases\nof American coal, petroleum, iron\nand steel, metal working machinery,\ntractors and industrial chemicals.\nImports into the United States\nfrom Canada also have increased.\nFor the 10-month period, according\nto Department of Commerce figures,\nthese, imports were valued at $342,\n000,000, as compared with $247,000,000\nfor the corresponding period in 1938\n1939. As a result of the virtual\nelimination of the Scandinavian\ncountries as a source of supply, the\nUnited States is buying much more\nCanadian newsprint paper and wood\npulp. Our purchases of Canadian\nnickel, fertilizers, asbestos and furs\nhave likewise increased.\nCanada is an important source\nof strategic materials for the United\nStates. The Dominion furnishes\nthis country with most of the nickel\nused in industry and national de\nfense. Canada also has valuable\nsupplies of asbestos, radium, mer\ncury, aluminum and several other\nmaterials of strategic importance.\nSurplus Wheat Is Problem.\nOne of the biggest economic prob\nlems faced by Canada today is that\nof the surplus of wheat and its\nstorage. Last year\u2019s crop was a\ngood one, leaving a carry-over of\nabout 280,000,000 bushels. There\nwill be another bumper crop this\nyear, with an estimated production\nof 400,000,000 bushels. The United\nStates can ofTer little outlet for\nCanadian wheat. The war has\neliminated the European market,\nand the United Kingdom buys wheat\nfrom Australia and Argentina, as\nwell as Canada.\nCanada\u2019s total exports to all for\neign countries in June were valued\nat $111,000,000, the highest figure in\na decade. The United Kingdom is\nCanadas best customer. For the\nfirst six months of 1940, Canada\u2019s\nexports were valued at $546,000,000.\nThe United Kingdom and Canada,\nin recent years, have been our two\nbest customers. The United States\nbuys, more from Canada than from\nany other country.\nMany American companies have\nestablished branch plants in Canada.\nThese are an important element in\nthe economy of the Dominion, and\nprovide employment for many Cana\ndian workers.\nThough the balance of trade be\ntween the two countries is still on\nthe side of the United States, Cana\nda continues to find a large market\nin this country for her products, as\nshown by the trade figures for the\n10 months ending in June.\nRites for Mrs. Keller\nFuneral services for Mrs. Olive\nRobinson Keller, wife of Represen\ntative Kent E.

J. FERGUSON, Pres.\nBox 432, Dept. B.\nlattiesburg, Miss.\nT\nEffect of Reciprocity\nOn Mississippi Products\nThe effect of the proposed Canadian\nreciprocity agreement, should it be\npassed by congress, on Mississippi pro\nducts, is shown by the following:\nCotton seed oil will be admitted*\ninto Canada from the United States\nfree of duty under the pending reci\nprocity legislation, in place of being\ntaxed 17 1-2 per cent ad Valorem, as\nat present. This arrangement is of\nthe highest interest to Mississippi,\nwhich rankB high among cotton seed\noil producing states. The manufacture\nof cotton seed oil, etc., is among the\nvery foremost of Mississippi's indus\ntries, both as to importance and vigor.\nThe significance of Canada's conces\nsion of free cotton seed oil to the\nAmerican producer may be measured\nby the fact that even in the face of\nthe present duty this country sold $1,\n111,400 worth of cotton seed oil in\nthe Dominion in calendar 1910, paying\napproximately 9200,000 in duty thereon.\nFresh Fruits.\nMississippi Wruit products\u2014peach\nes, melons, apples and grapes\u2014will\nenter Canada free of duty under the\nproposed reciprocity agreement. Since\nher fruits each year arrive at the\nmarketable stage many weeks before\nthe Canadian fruits commence to\nture, Mississippi will find the\narrangement a highly profitable one.\nThe Fruit Growers' Association, realiz\ning the value of the Canadian market,\nhas repeatedly petitioned the depart\nment of state to secure more favora\nble tariff conditions; and it Was with\nthese requests in mind that the Cana\ndian commissioners were asked and\nprevailed upon to concede with much\nreluctance, the removal of all duties\nj on fresh fruits entering Canada from\nI this country.\nma\nnew\nPeaches are at present taxed $1.00\nper 100 pounds by Canada, and this\nduty added to the cost of transporta\ntion, has Increased the Canadian de\nmand for peaches grown in this\ntion.\nsec\nThe Dominion at present, im\nposes a duty of three cents each\nmelons, thus hampering the creation\nof a Canadian market for our celebrat\ned Southern watermelons. The Cana\ndian duty on grapes, as well as\nstrawberries and other berries, is 2\ncents per pound. Apples are taxed\nby Canada at 40 cents per barrel, pears\nat 50 cents per 100 pounds and plums\nat 30 cents per bushel. The\nknown high quality of Mississippi\npeaches, grapes and melons will tend\nto gain for these products an Imme\ndiate sale In Canada\nupon\nwell\nso soon as the\ntariff barriers shall be removed. Even\nunder the present tariff statutes the\nUnited States .sold freeh\nCanada to\nCanada's last tscal\nfruits to\na value of $1,271,000 during\nyear, paying im\nport duties to the sum of $261,000.\nFresh Vegetables.\nFresh vegetables will be exempted\nfrom all duties, according to the pro\nposed reciprocity plan. This will give\nMississippi a larger range of markets\nfor her early potatoes aad garden ;\nduce onions, tomatoes, sweet potatoes\nor yams, etc.\npro\nThese will find a ready\nsale in the Dominion before the late\nripening Canadian\ncrops are gathered.\npotatoes\nCanada has hitherto taxed\n20 cents per bushel, sweet potatoes\n10 cents per bushel, and other vegeta\nbles 30 per cent ad valorem,\ntire abolition of these duties will\ndoubtedly stimulate America's exports\nto Canada of all kinds of fresh vegeta\nbles, and no state is better located to\nderive advantage from such\ntension of our trade than is Mississip\npi. Already the United States sells\nbeyond her northern border $865,560\nworth annually of vegetables in their\nThe en\nan ex\nBEAUTIFUL RAIR\nI\nThe Owl Drug Store Sells The Great\nest Hair Beautifier in the\nWorld.\nj Parisian Sage, the grand and effi\ncient hair restorer, is guaranteed to\ni permanently reinovs dandruff in two\nj weeks or your money back. j\nParisian Sage stops falling hair\u2014it\nj prevents the hair from fading.\n!\nIt is the best beautifier of ladies'\nhair, and it makes harsh, lusterless\nhair fluffy, soft and beautiful.

On canned fruits\nCanada lowers her duty by One-ninth,\nor from 2 1-4 cents to 2 cents per\npound; on canned vegetables the rate\nis lowered by one-sixth, or from 1 1-2\ncents to 1 1-4 cents per pound. Need\nless to say, Mississippi should profit\nby these concessions.\nHogs and Hog Products.\nMississippi's prominence as a s wlne\nproducing state is growing. Under\nthe proposed reciprocity Canada will\nreduce her duty on bacon, hams, pork\nand lard by three-eigtns, or from 2\ncents per pound to 1 1-4 cents per\npound. In spite of the present Cana\ndian duties, the United States export\ned to Canada $3,094,000 worth of these\nproducts during the year ended March\n31, 1910. Of the $505,000 of duties\ncollected by Canada on the above\nsignments, she would have remitted\n$190,000 if the proposed reciprocity\nrates had been in force. From this\nshowing it is evident at a glance that\nthe Dominion's demand for American\nhog products is already broad and de\ncisive, and that the proposed radical\ncut in her tariff rate will give our citi\nzens a large advantage in a market\nof demonstrated value. Canada bought\nbacon and hams from the United\nStates during the period indicated |\nabove to a value of $816,000, pork bar\nreled in brine to a value of $930,000, i\nand lard to a value of $1,340,000.\naccordance with the pending legisla-1\ntion Canada will also allow live swine\nfree entry, whereas they are at present |\ndutiable at 1 1-12 cents per pound. The j\nbenefits accruing to Mississippi from\nthese features of the\nquire no pointing out.\nNursery Stock.\nCanada has agreed to concede her\nintermediate rates upon nursery and\nhorticultural stock, taxing peach trees\nand other fruit trees 2 1-2 cents each\nin place of three cents each, and vines\nand berry bushes 17 1-2 per cent in\nstead of 20 per cent,\nsions will be of value to Mississippi\nnurserymen and growers of peach tree\nor vineyard stocks.\nFisfi, Fresh or Preserved.\ncon\nIn\nagreement re\n2\nThese conees\nUnder the proposed arrangement,\nfish of any kind, fresh, salted\nserved in any manner, are to-be mu\ntually free of duty.

Under the\nheading \"The Prince na Our Next Gov\nernor General\" the Leader of this city\nhns started a boom! for tho Prince to\nsucceed the Duko of Devonshire ns Governor-General\nof Canada. Tho editorial\nfollows:\n\"In almost every speech delivered by him\nIn Canada, and particularly In his larewell\nmessages on leavlnr lor England, the Prince\nof Wales made roforoneo to hli desire and\nIntention to roturn to Canada In the not i\ndistant future and to revisit this Dominion as I\nlroquently as potslblo. In fact, In ono mes\nsage he declared he would not be happy H\nmany months elapsed between visits to Can\nada. He refused to utter tho word good-by,\ncontenting himself with au rerolr.\n\"Undor those circumstances tho leader\nou!d make bold to offer the suggestion that\nIlls Royal Highness should bo named as tho\nnext Governor General of Canada.\n\"It Is understood that Hjs Kxcellency the\nDuke of Devonshire will relinquish the post\nnext year. No successor flulte so pleasing to\ntho Canadian people could bo named ns the\nPrince of Wales, and his presence tit Canada\nIn an olfldal capacity, and as an Integral\npart of the Government of tho Dominion\nwould serve to lurther knit tho bonds of\nunion between the Crown and tho Dominion\nmore closely than ever. In addition, the\npresence of Ills Iloyal Highness for a period\nof tlmo on the American continent could\nhavo no other effect, wo believe, than to\nstill furthor cement the ties of friendship\nbetween tho British Empire, as represented\nby Canada, and our kinsmen of tho United\nStates.\n\"Viewed from the Prlnco's own standpoint,\nand tho future of the whole empire. It can\nhardly bo doubted that tho training In af\nfairs of state which his Royal Highness\nwould obtain in the discharge of the duties\nof the Governor-Generalship would redound\nto bis own and tho empire's advantage when\nin .the course of nsturo he Is called upon\nto assume the throne of the world's might\niest and most glorious empire, even though,\nas we all trust will be tho case, that time\nmay be long postponed,\n\"Nor is the Prlnco's continual residence\nin Englapd required in the same degree that\nwas true of his grandfather, who as Prince\nof Wales was called upon to discharge msny\nof the public duties of his nged mother,\nVictoria the Good, or even of the present\nKing alter his father, when well up In years,\ncame to the throne as Edward VII, King\nGeorge V. Is still in the prime of life and fully\nable to bear .the strain of tho many func\ntions imposed upon the royal family at\nhome. Again., should some unforeseen and\nunfortunate emergimcj\" arise necessitating\nthe Prince's presence in England In these\ndays of practically Instantaneous communi\ncation between the Old World and thu New,\nand swift transportation. It would bo only a\nmatter of a few days, almost hours, be\nfore the Prince could land In England.\n\"It would not be necessary, nor perhaps\neven advisable, considering all Empire In\nterests, that the Prince should be appointed\nfor the usual full term of four or five years,\nbut bis active association with the Govern\nment of Canada for two or three years as\nGovernor-General would, we believe, prore\nof decided advantage to himself as the future\nKing over all British possessions, as well as\ndecidedly beneficial to Canada and pleasing\ntq the Canadian people.\"\nHIGHWAY TO CROSS CANADA\nIlond From Halifax to Vancostver\nk, , I Planned.\n\"America's Jtaln Street,\" as tho Lin\ncoln Highway has been dubbed, will ,oon\ntie duplicated in Canada.

Among em\nnlovers generally thero Is regard and re\nsped for Tom Moore, president of the\nDominion Trades and Labor Congress,\nnnd gratitude for tho Bteady and. re\nsponsible conduct of tho International\nunions during Jho year. On tho other\nhand, employers with roro exceptions\nare sympathetic toward labor and aro\nconvinced not only of tho Justice but of\ntho wisdom of conference and coopera\ntion with their workmen.\nNotwithstanding tho uncertainties\nwhich attend reconstruction, wages hnve\nbeen woll maintained. Indoed, there\nliavo been many wngo Increases nnd\nfow decreases. Tho railways and other\ngreat corporations have been not only\nwilling but eager to relnatato returned\nsoldiers In their old places, or to provide\nthem with better ones; and tho vast\nbody of manufacturers, together with\nthe banking nnd financial corporations,\nhave strictly observed all pledges made\nto the soldiers when they cnllstod. Thero\nIs perhaps some danger of unemploy\nment during tho winter, but tho Govern\nments aro watching tho situation with\nvigilance, nnd It la certain that em\nployers will coopcrato to prevent serious\ndistress among working people.\nDuring tho year, unUer tho energetic\ndirection of tho Canadian Manufacturers\nAssociation, many group organizations\nhave been completed nnd much Initiative\nand activity displayed In preparing for\nexport business. Probably tho Indus\ntries of Canada never were moro effi\ncient. It Is certain that tho pardonable\nconfidence In themselves and their\nworkmen which the experiences of the\nwar developed has not been lost. They\nnever wcro In a better position to serve\ntho home market at reasonable prices,\nand certainly were never in so good a\nposition to supply markets abroad.

It\nmay be that we aro on tho eve of a\nperiod of unsettled government. There\nIs, however no general disposition to\nlook to the future with apprehension,\nand there ir a high confidence that,\nwhatever happens politically, Canada\nwill contlnuo to develop and expand\nand carry with buoyancy the debt which\nthe war has laid upon us.\nlly FHAXK J).

C. A. 3IAGBATH,\nCollodion Chairman of the International\nJoint Commission and Canadian\nFuel Controller,\nIt Is generally felt that Canada has at\nlast an established stand on the com\nmercial front streot of tho world, which\ncarries with It tho necessity of her doing\nher share In tho policing of that (street.\nThere aro two relations between na\ntions, namely, political and commercial ;\nthe extent of the latter being largely\ngoverned by tho sanity of the former.\nTho political relations between tho\nUnited States and Canada are sane\nthat Is one milestone on tho road to a\nsane world. In fact, tho political rela\ntions among the English-speaking units\naro sound, though occasionally disturbed\nthrough local Influences.\nCanada has every reason to appreciate\nthe real worth of her neighbor, and Ca\nnadian Influence should always bo avail\nable In drawing her sister nations and\ntho United States closor together for\na saner world. And there are still other\nmilestones on the rond but all In good\ntlmo.\nMy experience as a Canadian in the\nUnited States has been fairly Intimate\nduring the last eight years as a member\nof tho International Joint Commission,\nwhich came Into existence through a\ntreaty In 1909 between tho United States\nand Great Hrltaln. The commission con\nsists of six members three citizens of\nthe United States and three citizens of\nCanada. Its functions aro to deal with\ndifferences between the two countries.\nLittle Is publicly known of the activi\nties of the commission, though It has set\ntled somo very Important International\nissues. Now, with my eight years' ex\nperience, what have I to say about Cana\ndian relations with tho United States?\nMerely this:\nWe are the same people, with the same\nIdeals. Our commercial relations will\n?row with great rapidity. Many diffi\ncult questions will arlsu between us:\nbut, being approached In a broad-minded\nway a square deal to both sides they\nwill be solved as they arise.\nI have had other experiences with the\nUnited States on behalf of Canada\nnamely, as my country's Fuel Controller\nduring the laBt three years. Canada Im\nports nbout 60 per cent, of her fuel from\nher neighbor, and all through the trying\nperiods of the coal crises I was treated\nmost fairly and with every consideration\nby the authorities In Washington.\nTo my mind the clearest evidence of\nwlso statesmanship on both sides of tho\nborder will be In the fostering of every\npolicy looking to a clearer and un\nequivocal understanding as to unity of\naction by the two political branches of\ntho English-speaking world. Should\nsome trouble breeder turn loose, let us\nfaco tho Issue shoulder to shoulder not\nfor commercial gain, because each Is a\nvigorous peoplo nnd does not need favors\nof any kind but only fair play; hut be\ncause, as truly democratic nations, with\na proper sense of our responsibility to\nour own people and tho peoples of tho\nworld, we cannot do otherwise.

The Canadians\nwere stung by the unjust tariff pol\nicy of England toward them and\nsought relief and additional prosperity\nby aiming to secure improved trade\nrelations with the United States whose\nrapid and remarkable advancement in\nwealth at once excited the envy of and\nserved as a stimulus to the lagging\npeople just north of the great repub\nlic England had imposed on Canada\ndifferential duties which discriminated\nIn favor of the former country and\ni against the United States and contin\n; tied the unpopular policy until 1845\nwhen it was deemed best to placate\nthe people by permitting the Canadian\n(Legislature to regulate its own tariff;\nand. in the exercise of its new priv\nilege, the provincial Parliament in 1847\nabolished the differential duties and\nadmitted imports from the United\nStates on the same terms as from\nGreat Britain. Prominent among the-\ncauses that induced the British gov\nernment to change its attitude on the\ntariff was fear of the marked tend\nency in Canada to favor annexation to\nthe United States. Even after the\nconsiderable concessions made by Eng\nland discontent was not entirely allay\ned, and Lord Elgin, the Governor-General\nof Canada from 1847-1854, desiring\nto bead off any attempt that might\nbe made to obtain annexation and\nrecognizing that through the acquire\nment of a reciprocity treaty with the\nUnited States he could best suit his\npirpose. put forth a successful ana\n(dnnagfins effort to negotiate It.\nAlthough the tariff change made by\nCanada in 1847 placed the United\nStates on am equality with England by\nlowering the duties on American man\nufactures from 12 to 7 per cent.,\nand by raising those on British man\nufactures from 5 to 7, the American\npeople did not appear to recognize\nthat they had gained enough to be\neiy interested.

Ques\ntions connected with the fisheries on\nthe coasts of British North America\ncould not be ignored. These ques\ntions, of course, involved the Interests\nof the maritime provinces much more\nthon those of Canada proper, and arose\nfrom several different ways of inter\npreting the treaty of 1818. The evi\ndence, indeed, points to the conclusion\nthat the United States wanted various\nconcessions to be granted in return\nfor yielding to Canada's urgent desire\nfor the free admission of certain arti\ncles reciprocally. The two countries\napproached the question of reciprocity\nfrom different standpoints, the United\nStates not expecting to gain much\nfrom the free exchange of \" products,\n'certainly not nearly as much as Can\nada, would.\nVarious reasons can be cited to show\nwhy the people of this country were\nnot eager or anxious for a free ex\nchange of raw materials with Canada\nat the time when there was agitation\nfor the reciprocity treaty which was\nfinally agreed upon in 1854. Prices to\nthe domestic consumer were not then,\nas in these days of outrageously pro\ntected trusts, raised to an abnormal\nheight, or. at least, to a height that\ncould be burdensomely felt. Indeed,\nhigh protective duties were not en\nforced in the existing tariff. Not only\nwere the tariff duties low, from 1846\nto the opening of the Civil War, but\nthe commerce of the country was also\na great deal smaller in volume, and\nthe need for its extension was much\nless imperative than at present. Our\nvest territory possessed great and\nvaried natural resources, and to use\nthem there were, according to the cen\nsus figures, only 23.191.876 persons in\n1850 as against 7,304,79B, or more than\nthree times as many in 1900. The\npeople felt that they were independent\nand self-sufficing At the same time\nthere was little active objection to a\nfree exchange of raw materials under,\nreciprocity because the general ten\ndency of the time was toward lessen\ning restrictions on international trade;\nas shown in the United' States by the\nadoption of the Walker tariff, which\nwas rather a revenue than a protec\ntive tariff; in England by the repeal\nof the corn laws about 1846; at an\nearlier period' by the organization of\nthe German Zollvereln which by means\nof reciprocal concessions greatly aug\nmented the trade between the German\nStates. The liberal trend notably\nwidened' in 1860 when was negotiated\nan Anglo-French treaty which by\nmeans of reciprocity, the removal of\nnot a few duties on exports and im\nports and of all absolute prohibitions\ncleared away to a very marked extent\ncommercial barriers standing between\nEngland and France. This important\ntreaty was followed by twenty-seven\nsimilar treaties in which all of the\nStates of Europe, except Greece, were\ninterested. Even backward Russia\ncaught the spirit of progress and join\ned in the movement.\n\"It needs hardly to be said,\" say\nProfessors Laugh! in and Willis in\ntheir recently published book, entitled\n\"Reciprocity\", \"that under these con\nditions, the prosperity of European\ntrade increased enormously. The\ncommerce of Austria, Belgium, France,\nHolland, Italy and Great Britain grew\nbetween 1860 and 1873 more than 100\nper cent., while the trade of the same\ncountries with nations not having\nreciprocity treaties with them in\ncreased, according to Mr. David A.\nWells, only about 66 per cent.\"\nThe outlook of the world was wid\nening, nations were more and more\ntrading with each other in the natural\nmanner, removing from commerce\nthose shackles on liberty which In\nmany different and unjust ways have\never tended to retard the progress of\ntrue civilization. Great, indeed, had\nbeen the advance from the ignorant,\nnarrow policy of the middle ages when\nrestrictions on the freedom of trade\nwere even enforced between the dis\ntricts of the same country; from the\nearly period when in France and in\nother northern countries of Europe the\nlevying of the odious octroi was prev\nalent, it being a toll or tax upon arti\ncles that passed the entrance of a\ntown; from the English tariffs which\nwere prohibitory before the reign of\nQueen Elizabeth. Nothing promotes\nbetter conditions between countries\nthan mutually beneficial and friendly\ncommercial conditions long continued.\nBut, alas, the barbaric and selfish\nimpulses of mankind were destined to :\nbe aroused from slumber. The un\nfortunate frictions which caused the\nCivil War In the United States and the\nFranco-Prussian war In Europe\nbrought about great and adverse\nchanges. Herbert Spencer has clear\nly shown In his \"Principles of Socio-\npgy\" that \"the governmental-military\nOrganization of a society is initiated\nby, and evolves along with, the war\nfare between societies.\" Under such\nconditions aggressions and infliction\nof injuries are not alone felt by the\noutward enemy. The effect is reac\ntive. Within the society defended by\nlarge armies the militant tendency\ngrows, although in a milder form.\nGreater and sterner restrictions are\nplaced upon the personal liberty of the\ncitizen than when there is no war.\nFor instance, he must express opinions\nand guide his actions in conformity\nwith the controlling feeling of the peo\nple or he will meet with the fate of\nthe Tories during the Revolutionary\nWar or endure indignities and losses\nas did the loyal Unionists who lived in\nour Southern States at the time of the\nrebellion. He will have to pay high\ner taxes for the sake of carrying on a\nwar that he may believe to be unjust.\nExtra revenues must be raised to meet\nheavy expenses of feeding, clothing\nand equipping large bodies of soldiers\nin the field. Abnormal duties will be\nplaced on imports. Internal revenue\ntaxes may likewise be levied on bank\nchecks, matches and other things suit\ned to the purpose. Then, after the\nfighting is over and the need for rais\ning large sums of money is greatly\ndiminished, changes like those which\nwere made after our Civil War may\nbe expected. The burdens on excises\nwill be to a great extent removed but\nthe high tariff on imports will be re\ntained or only a little lessened through\nthe infleunce of manufacturers who\nby means of this tariff have been en\nabled to raise prices to domestic con\nsumers to an abnormal extent and who\ndesire to continue advantages unneces\nsary and unjust in times of peace. The\nmanufacturers conceal their selfish\npurpose under the false and hypocrit\nical plea that they are so full of solici\ntude for their workmen that they fa\nvor the excessive duties in order that\nthey may be able to pay their em\nployes high wages, ignoring the fact\nthat such wages chiefly depend upon\nthe efficiency of the hired toiler and\nthe demand for labor. The people in\ngeneral, benumbed by the militant in\nfluences that have taken from them\nthe appreciation of individual liberty\nand the keen zest for it that they pos\nsessed in the preceding peaceful era.\nare skillfully guided Into the wrong\nway of thinking and are actually\nmade to believe that a tariff once ac\nknowledged to be for revenue only\nshould be retained solely or principally\nfor the protection \" and coddling of\nhome industries.\nThe wars which I have mentioned\nrudely Interrupted, the strong and wide\nmovement toward greater freedom in\ninternational trade and substituted the\nhigh tariffs and high tariff tendencies\nwhich are the rule rather than the ex\nception at the present day. Big\nstanding armies and high tariffs are\ntwo of the leading burdens under\nwhich Europe now groans.

The crisis from the situation of the country, so\nor panic or io unsettled Dusiness\nto a marked extent in the United\nStates and to some extent in Canada,\nbut was fortunately not long in dura\ntion. \"In the inquiries which were\nmade as to the causes of the crisis,\"\nwrites Prof. William G. Sumner, \"the\nstate of the currency was generally\nrecognized as the root of the trouble.\"\nIt Is clear that the crisis -udely inter\nrupted an encouraging growth in trade\nbetween the United States and the\nBritish provinces in the first years of\nthe treaty, both imports and exports\nfalling off largely in 157 and 1858,\nparticularly in the latter year, fol\nlowed in 1859 by a noteworthy bound\ntoward improved conditions. But the\nbusiness crisis was merely like a thun\nder shower which makes big commo\ntion, then quickly passes away, leav\ning a landscape flooded with sunlight\nand full of promise. Far more seri\nous was the effect of the Civil War of\n1861-65, and we should also allow for\nthe effect of the troublesome agitations\nthat led up to it, agitations developed\nfrom the increasing hostility between\nthe North and the South on account of\nthe slavery question.\nThe most important deduction to be\nsoundly made from the statistics cov\nering the working of the treaty is that\nunder the favorable years of\nthe\ntreaty, I meaning by favorable years\nthose which were not disturbed by the\nbusiness crisis and actual warfare,\nthere was a marked- increase in the\ntrade between the two countries; and\nit seems safe to conclude that a large\npart of this increase, at least, was due\nto the direct effect of the treaty itself.\n(For an exhaustive presentation and\ndiscussion of the relevant statistics, see\nthe valuable pamphlet entitled \"The\nReciprocity Treaty with Canada of\n1854,\" written by Frederick E. Haynes,\nPh. D., and published by the Ameri\ncan Economic Association.)\nConcerning the working of the treaty\nduring its latter years I may fittingly\nquote from the already mentioned book\nof Laughlin and Willis as follows:\n\"During the war, of course, when\nthe productive power of our own coun\ntry was curtailed, we naturally looked\nto Canada for supplies, and 1860 and\n1861 were the only years in which our\nimports from tr.at country exceeded\nour exports during the life of the\ntreaty, until just at the time the agree\nment was about to close. Recovery\nhad already begun before the end of\nthe Civil War, and 1864 might be con\nsidered a more normal year. Then,\nwith the general recognition of the fact\nthat the treaty was practically certain\nto be abrogated, came a great rush to\nbring quantities of Canadian goods\nover the border before the duties again\nbecame effective. This movement ac\ncounts for the. abnormal increase in\nimports in 1865, and particularly in\n1866, which fell off as sharply in 1867. I\nDuring the four years after the ter\nmination of the treaty 1867-1870 trade\ncontinued on a lower but fairly nor\nmal level, and the close of the period\nshows a marked tendency to an In\ncrease in both exports and imports.\"\nIt .may be said that the reciprocity\ntreaty was popular in Canada through\nout its life, certainly there was little,\nIf any, noteworthy opposition to it,\nand the dissatisfaction that brought\nabout its abrogation was on the part\nof the United States. At first the\ntreaty was favorably regarded by the\npeople of both countries. The idea\nwas also prevalent among us that the\ntreaty would pave the way toward a\ncloser bond of 'inion with Canada, one\nwriter express.' himself as follows:\n\"A people so identified (with us), it\nIs argued, cannot long remain politic\nally separated, but must be united by\nannexation. Events will probably\njustify this last line of reasoning.\nBut whenever annexation comes, be it\nsooner or later, the operation of the\ntreaty will make it, beyond all doubt,\na peaceful, amicable, and altogether\nsalutary transition.\"\nBut following the crisis of 1857 dis\nsatisfaction began and increased in\nthe United States in various ways\nwhich Influenced not a few to enter\ntain the notion that Canada was gain\ning under the treaty advantages a good\ndeal greater than we obtained. There\nis an unlikeness between the inhabit\nants of different countries, even when\nthey speak the same language and are\nof the same ethnical stock, which pre\ndisposes them to be jealous and sus\npicious in their mutual dealings. Their\ngovernments. their interests, their\npoints of view, their ways of doing\nthings are sufficiently divergent to\nmake the cementing of close and quite\nfriendly relations more or less slow\nand difficult. Wide prejudice still ex\nists against a foreigner Just because\nhe is a foreigner and because his in\nterests are supposed to be opposed to\nours, and, it must be recollected, this\nprejudice, founded in ignorance and\nnourished by ignorance, was once very\nstrong, not comparatively mild, as it\nis in this day of enlightenment when\na population more heterogenous than\nformerly, due to the emigration of peo\nple from many countries, occupies the\nUnited States and when a greater and\nmore intimate relationship with other\nnations exists 'because of wonderfully\nchanged conditions with which every\nmoderately informed person is well\nacquainted. The felling toward Eng\nland had not been improved by two\nwars with her. that of the Revolution\nand that of 1812, and Canada as a de\npendence of Great Britain had to share\nin any dislike that might be manifest\ned toward the English.\nThe evidence points to the conclusion\nthat the causes for dissatisfaction were\nnot sufficient to sustain the claim that\nCanada derived far more benefit from\nthe treaty than did the United States,\nand the notion that she did may be re\ngarded as an exaggeration largely\ntraceable to the prejudice against for\neigners and In the selfish attitude of\ncertain interests which are wont to ar\ngue that anything interfering with\ntheir profits- must be prejudicial to the\ncountry in general although, in real\nity, the welfare of the country and es\npecially of. its consumers may be great\nly promoted. Everybody is a con\nsumer, and yet, m tai-irr matters, the\nimmense interests of millions of con\nsumers are commonly relegated to the\nbackground while in the foreground\ngreat stress Is iaid on the claim that\na certain industry or a few industries\nwill be harmed or benefited if duties\nare made different than they are now.\nCertainly the reciprocity treaty with\nCanada was helpful to the great ma\njority of American consumers, but con-\nLsumers are seldom adequately repre\nsentea at Hearings given by Congres\nsional committees They are custom\narily too inert to make their wishes\nTHE FARMER: APRIL\nmade by the opponents of the treaty\nwas to 'the s.n-naUo \"vinintlnn of the\nspirit of the treaty,\" on the part of\nCanada, because she increased her tar-\nments that were considered necessary\nor very desirable for the development , untoward and unusual circumstances\nof the resources of the provinces. Can- I and was not extended far enough un\nals and railroads were built and im- der normal and favorable conditions\nprovements were also made In canals . for a clear and satisfactory demonstra-\nand in the navigation of the St. Law-\nrence river. Mr. Frederick B. Haynes\ntakes the ground that the object of\nthese works was as much political as\ni commercial, \"the desire of the Canad\neasily developed into a deei-re for an\nnexation to the United States.\" Mr.\nHaynes points out that to obtain the\nlarge revenues needed for the improve\nments increase of taxation was essen\ntial, and that the easier method seem\ned to be to raise the tariff. '\"This,\"\nhe adds, \"could not be done in the case\nof those articles included in the treaty,\nbut could be done in the case of man\nufactured goods. This was done, and\nthen arose the grievance of which the\nAmericans so bitterly complained.\nFrom year to year, as greater revenue\nwas required, a higher tariff was im\nposed to the increasing disgust of the\nAmerican manufacturer.\"\nIn this connection it is important to\nconsider some things contained in a\nreport, dated May, 1860, and made by\nJohn W. Taylor to the Secretary of\nthe Treasury of the United States. In\nthis report Mr. Taylor seems to have\ntaken a broad and unprejudiced view,\ni favoring Canada to an extent that\ncould hardly have been expected. He\ncompared at length the American tar\niffs of 1846 and 1867 with the Canadian\ntariff of 1858 and found that Cajmda\nhad done nothing more than to tiring\nher duties up so as to approach an\nequality with ours. Mr. Taylor even\nclaimed that the demand that Canada\nshould put her duties back to where\nthey were when the reciprocity treaty\nwas ratified or endure the abrogation\nof the treaty itself, bordered on arro\nganee in view of the fact that the du\n, ties imposed under the tariff of 1867\nwere at least per ceni. niner tnaai\nthe corresponding rates of the Canad\nian tariff. Referring to the pamphlet\nof Mr. Haynes again, I find that he\nadmits that the complaint of the\nAmericans might have had a doubtful\njustification before the outbreak of the\nCivil War, while the tariff of 1867 was\nin force, but he adds: \"It could have\nnone at all after the war tariffs came\ninto existence. Even under the tariff\nof 1857 the tariff rate of the United\nStates upon cotton and woolen goods\nwas 24 per cent., 4 per cent, higher\nthan the Canadian duty under the tar\niff of 1859.\"\nBut suoh facts as have just been\ncited had to contend with popular\nprejudice and the self-interest of pro\nducers, and we all know that a biased\nmind seeks to justify itself rather than\nto learn the truth against which, in\ndeed, it often steels Itself with a per\ntinacity that would be astonishing,\nwere we not aware that men are gov\nerned far more by strong feelings en\ngendered by prejudice than they are\nby rationality.\nBut the commercial and economical\nobjections to the treaty that to which\nI have made reference and others that\neither were advanced or may have\nbeen advanced' were not the direct\nand predominating cause of the abro\ngation of the treaty. Indeed, it may\nwell be doubted whether these objec\ntions alone, un trammeled by the com\nplications leading to and following the\nopening of the Civil War, would have\nended the efforts to promote ieciprocal\ntrade between the two countries. I\nwrite advisedly; for, in spite of the\nmore or less- dissatisfaction here and\nthere, there was a. strong sentiment in\nthe United. States which favored the\ncontinuance of liberal trade arrange\nments with Canada. This sentiment\nwas unmistakably shown in a conven\ntion held at Detroit, July 11-14, 1865.\nThe convention was composed of\nprominent business men and others\nrepresenting the leading commercial\nbodies of the United States ,and the\nBritish North American provinces and\ncame \"to substantial unanimity, and\nthey united in urging upon the gov\nernment at Washington the great im\nportance of Immediately opening nego\ntiations with the British government\nfor a new arrangement, at the least as\nliberal on both sides as the one about\nto expire had been, and as much\nbroader as should appear practicable.\nTheir action was approved by every\nBoard of Trade and Chamber of Com\nmerce in the country taking any in\nterest in the matter; it was disapprov\ned, so far as we ever heard, by none.\"\nCertainly the business interests in\na broad sense put themselves on rec\nord as desirous that reciprocity with\nCanada should be continued in some\nform; but the unhappy political influ\nences of the time were sufficient to\noverride wise utilitarian considerations,\nand were the direct cause of the abro\ngation of the treaty as is freely ac\nknowledged by all writers on the sub\nject whom I have consulted. One of\nthem, Goldwin Smith, the famous his\ntorian, has expressed himself as fol\nlows: \"To the anger which the behavior of\na party in England had excited in\nAmerica Canada owes the loss of the\nreciprocity treaty. If Great\nBritain can, with justice, say 'that she\nhas paid heavily for the defense of\nCanada, Canada can with equal jus\ntice reply that she has paid heavily In\nthe way of commercial sacrifice for\nthe policy of Great Britain.\"\nI have already mentioned the hin-\ndrance to enlightened and friendly re-\nlatlons between the inhabitants of dif\nferent countries which springs from\nthe instinctive and unreasonable preju\ndice against a foreigner simply be\ncause he is a foreigner. If the effect\nof this prejudice was seen in our com\nmercial relations with Canada to some\nextent, as has been pointed out, much\nmore was It apparent in the political\ncomplications which arose between\nEngland and the United States at the\ntime of the Civil War and in which\nCanada was involved as a third party\nwhose political affiliations, of course,\ndrew her to Great Britain but whose\ncommercial interests, on the other\nhand, urgently demanded maintenance\nof friendly relations with the great\ncountry lying just south of her. Can\nada may indeed be regarded as the\nunfortunate victim of circumstances\nwhich she was helpless to control.\nShe wanted the treaty continued, for,\nafter the year's notice of its termina\ntion had been given by the United\nStates, the Canadians sent a delega\ntion to this country for the purpose\nof securing an extension of the treaty.\nIf possible. The delegates axrrvea in\nWashington on January 24, 1866. and\nremained until February 6th. But\ntheir of forts were in vain.\nI gather from the evidence that both\nEngland and the United States were\nmuch swayed by prejudice and by re\nfusal to investigate the facts. The\nUnited States could point to serious\ngrievances suoh as those connected\nwith the depredations of the \"Ala\nbama\" and other Confederate cruis\ners that hod been built in English\nports and allowed to escape from them.\nOn the other hand, the evidence is\n2, 1909.\nland must be with the South or the\nCnnfwlwate States \"because the Brit-\n, Ish were large consumers of cotton,\nNevertheless, although it is a fact lit-\nits operation was greatly disturbed by\ni tion of what it could do. .\nI SINCE THE ABROGATION OF THE\nTREATY.\nWithin a year we have heard' a good\ndeal said- about the advisability of\ntrying to negotiate another reciprocity\ntreaty with Canada and the subject\npromises to become one of paramount\nimportance, at least In Is ew England;\nbut for many years after the abroga\ntion of the treaty there was little to\nencourage the hope that liberal trade\narrangements with Canada would be\nresumed. To be sure, there were\nmade toward them numerous attempts,\nemanating chiefly from the Canadians\nand finally to some extent from the\nUnited States: but these attempts, not\nbeing backed by a powerful public sen\ntiment, attracted very little attention\nand soon languished or became abor\ntive. In the winter of 1897. the year in\nwhich the present highly protective\nDlngley tariff was adopted, the Canad\nians made their last serious effort to\nbring about a treaty of reciprocity\nwith the United States. From \"The\nCyclopedic Review of Current His\ntory,\" Vol. VIL 1897, pages 174-175, un\nder the head \"The Dominion Parlia\nment,\" I quote as follows:\n\"The liberal hopes for a treaty of\nreciprocity with the United States on\nthe basis of mutual concessions have\nbeen for the present abandoned. The\ntendency of fiscal policy In the United\nStates, as embodied in the Dlngley bill,\npromises no relief to Canadian trade.\nConsequently the remissions to be\nmade in Canadian rates will be grant\ned as far as possible to goods of which\nthe principal import is from Great\nBritain. Canada will look elsewhere\nthan across her southern border for a\nmarket for her goods, and will pos\nsibly retaliate by discriminating\nagainst American products.\n\"In accordance with the policy of the\nliberals, overtures were made by Can\nada, looking to a reciprocity arrange\nment; but they met with no encour\nagement Early in February Sir\nRichard Cartwright, minister of Trade\nand Commerce, and Hon. L H. Da vies,\nminister of Marine and Fisheries, vis\nited Washington to confer with the\nRepublican leaders on the matter.\nThey had been preceded in January by\nMessrs. Charlton and Farrar in on\nunofficial capacity.\"\nIt is interesting to notice that the\nrepulse which the overtures from Can\nada received from the United States\ninduced the Dominion government to\nretaliate by discriminating against\nAmerican products through the enact\nment of the Preferential British Tariff\nof 1897. Under this tariff duties on\nimports from the United Kingdom and\nnot a few of its colonies were reduced\n12 per cent. In 1898 this reduction\nwas increased to 25 per cent, and in\n1900 to 33 1-3 per cent., and has been\ncontinued at the latter rate to the\npresent day. Nevertheless, in spite of\nthe handicap of this preferential tariff,\nthe exports of the United States to\nCanada have steadily and gratifyingly\ngrown as can be learned from the sta\ntistics that appear in a statement sent\nout from Washington, D. C, in De\ncember, 1904, by the Department of\nCommerce and Labor, through its Bu\nreau of Statistics. The figures are\nimpressive. They 'show the size, im\nportance and great increase in the\ntrade between the two countries, the\nsignificant balance of trade In favor of\nthe United States, and the very note\nworthy fact that during the operation\nof the preferential tariff the share\nwhich the United States supplies of\nthe total imports into Canada has\ngrown more rapidly than that of the\nUnited Kingdom, favored though It\nhas been by & special and considerable\nprotection.\nIt is natural that contiguous coun\ntries should trade with each other\nmore than they do with distant coun\ntries and the strength and persistency\nr.f this natural tendency are strikingly\nseeen in the commercial relations of\nCanada, and the United States. Not\nwithstanding high protective and pref\nerential tariffs, jealousies, narrow\nmindedness, selfishness, stupidity, in a\nword, various kinds of discourage\nments and drawbacks, the natural ten\ndencies of trade have moved forward\nin their indomitable, inevitable course.\nThe goal is freedom from tariff and\nall other artificial shackles which pre\nvent men and nations from dealing in\nthe manner which, broadly considered,\nIs the most advantageous to them all.\nThe studenc of history, of government,\nof economics, of sociology, would, in\ndeed, be discouraged, did he not reach\nthe cheerful conclusion that through\nthe toil, the misery, the injustice, the\nmistakes, the reactions, the painfully\nslow 'progress of the ages, the power\nof natural and moral law is never\novercome and ever works unconquered\ntoward what is better.\nThe attitude of Canada during the\nperiod of which I have written was\none which an unprejudiced spectator\nwould praise. She excelled the United\nStates in efforts to bring about reci\nprocity and she did not wish the\ntreaty of 1854 to be abrogated. After\nits abrogation she favored the estab\nlishment of closer and broader rela\ntions wlththi s country until her over\ntures in 1897 were opposed by our\ngovernment in such a manner that\nshe became offended, if not disgust\ned, and soon after retaliated by\nadopting the preferential duties which\ndiscriminated against the United\nStates. We cannot particularly blame\nher, seemingly we cannot blame her\nat all: and now we should pause be\nfore seeking to provoke her further\nand consider that she has it in her\npower to do us yet more Injury. In\nthe Review of Reviews, October num\nber, 1903, Eugene Hay says:\n\"Our average tariff on dutiable\ngoods coming from Canada to the\nUnited States is 4 9.83 per cent., and\nthe Canadian average tariff on dutia\nble goods going from the United\nStates into Canada is 2 4.83 per cent.\nUnless commercial reciprocity is soon\nobtained Canadian tarlfTs will un\ndoubtedly be raised to approximately\nthe level of our own. which will prac\ntically destroy commerce between the\ncountries.\"\nIt is a time when we should exer\ncise calm judgment, for the condi\ntions are now so rapidly changing that\nfar-seeing men recognize that we shall\nsoon need more liberal trade arrange\nments with Canada more than she will\nneed them with us.\nF0IIY5 KIDNEY CURE\n1\nWill cure any case of Kidney or Bladder Disease not\nbevand tv .r of medicine. Mo medicine can do more.\nV. B. Brill.\nMindful of the rebuffs she has re\nceived from the United States and of\nher present prosperous condition, Can\nada is in a rather independent mood\njust now. At the sixth annual ban\nquet of the Canadian club of Boston\non November 28, 1904, George E. Fos\nter, M. P., from North Ontario, said:\n\"Before I came to the banquet I\nwas told that I would be expected to\nspeak on reciprocity. What is abso\nlutely a dead question with us is very\nmuch alive with you. During my\nterm of service with the Conservative\nparty and while a member of the\nCanadian government, I made two or\nthree pilgrimages to Washington and\nbegged your senators and representa\ntives to grant us reciproeial trade re\nlations. I failed in my mission every\ntime. And now that tiie creation J\ndead with us it has been raised from\nits grave by some of vou Americans\nCanada may be trusted to work out\nher own salvation without the aid of\nany reciprocal treaty witn the United\nStates.\nSuch is the discouraging attitude of\nCanada at the very time when many\npeople in New England as well as\nmillers in the Northwest who desire\nCanadian wheat for making into flour\nfavor putting our commerce with\nCanada on a more libera basis. For\nthe Eastern States the case is thus\nsuccinctly stated by the New Tork\nTimes:\n\"In New England the revolt against\nthe burdens of the present tariff sys\ntem is more formidable because it is\nbased on practical and immediate in\nterest. That section of the country\nwishes to buy of Canada. It needs\nfuel and iron and lumber and wood\npulp and other materials and requi\nsites of manufactures, and it is fined\nheavily if it seeks them In Canadian\nmarkets, where they can be had in\nexhaustless quantities and at relative\nly low prices. As a manufacturing\nsection its business has largely gone\nWest with the movement of popula\ntion and the development of the re\nsources of that vast region. Its fu\nture growth in prosperity unquestion\nably depends on the ability to get ma\nterials and fuel at low cost. Hence\nthe increasing earnestness of its bus\niness men for the reduction of duties\neither directly or by reciprocity.

Douglass, the new gov\nernor of Massachusetts, in his recent\ninauerural address, set forth cogent\nreasons why Massachusetts should re\nceive the aid to be derived from a\nsuitable reciprocity treaty with Cana\nda.\nIt is reported that the farmers and\nmerchants of Canada are quite strong\nly In favor of negotiating a reciproci\nty treaty with the United States. On\nthe other hand, the manufacturers\nand politicians do not want it. No\ndoubt if the question were made a\nleading issue there would uiso be a\ndivided sentiment in the United States;\nfor selfish and personal interests are\nso much involved in all tariff matters\nthat it is impossible to get up any\ntariff plan for benefit in the broadest\nsense that will not be bitterly fought\nby some.

It is so far a wilderness, not\nvet explored, but what little of it has\nbeen touched is remarkably rich in min\neral, ''As ovory mining man knows, tlio\nolder tho country in a geological sense\ntho better the mineral deposits, if it\nhas any at all.

Americans\ndo not know Alaska any more than they\ndo Canada; Alaska and Klondike are\noften spoken of as the samo tiling,\nmore or less, especially in a milling\nsense. Now Klondike is in Canada.\n\"I havo not the figures at hand, but\nI .believe Canada has turned out more\ngold than has Alaska: and the whole\nworld know? what Cobalt has done in\nproducing silver. Colorado and Utah\nhave grout silver mines, some of tho\nbest in the world, but they cannot be\ncompared to the silver mine's of Canada.\n\"T do nol meution all this in a spirit\nof boasting, but merely with the nope\nof corroding some of the many wrong\nimpressions about Canada in this coun\ntry.

The' can\ncarry the trade of the Orient across\nI the continent or to Chicago cheaper\nI than can 3-011 r American railroads.\nThere are a good many reasons for this,\nbut .just to mention two: Their grades\nare hotter, their instance shorter, and\ntheir taxes arc less. I'ou tax some of\na mile. We tax ours only $1000 a mile.\nThe shipper pays the railroad iax of\ncourse, and our roads can make money\nwhere 3'ours will lose mone3' on the\nsamo business.\nCheaper Railroad Rates.\n\"Tlio great tra'ftic, of this countrv\nwill eventually bo north and south, as\nThe Tribune says, Tho continental\nhaul that tho Americans have had al\nmost a monopoly of for so long thev\nmust expect to 'lose to tlie Canadian\ntranscontinental lines, especiallv to tho\nGrand Trunk Pacific, with onlv one\nhalf 4f 0110 per cent grade from\" ocean\nto ocean, and a shorter haul at that.\n\"In nddition to this, as The Tribune\npoints out. Prince Knpert. the West\nern terminus, i.s nearer Asia hv mnnv\nhundreds of miles than is your most\nWestern, or rather most Northern sea\nport, on Pugot sound. The shortest\nsea route to Asia, remember, is right\nup the North American coast and down\nthe Asiatic coast.

American rail\nroads cannot, comprMo against this. It\nis impossible. Besides our railroads\nare partly government institutions, run\nfor the sood of the country and not to\npay dividends on watered stock nor 1o\npiiy heav3 taxes-. Americnn railroads\nmust then develop their local liafiie.\nand their north and south traffic, with\nwhich, of course, Canada cannot com\npete. Needs Cotton and Fruit.\nWe need your cotton, and can nevei 1\nraise any cotton of our own. Wo need\n3'our corn, and cannot mine it as 3ou\ncan iu Iowa and Illinois. But you can\nnot, except in limited iiuautities in the\nnorthern part of 3-0111 country\", raise\ntho wheat Canada can. And wheat is\ntho great food Bluff of tho world, just\nas cotton ib tho one great staple for\nclothing, Canada will trade her wheat\nfor your cotton. You will need our lum\nber, and our coal. Canada can send\n3011 coal cheaper than you. can get it\nfrom mau3 parts of 3our conntr. You\nI havo a tariff cvon today to keep out\nj our ores, our timber, our coal, and other\nI raw material. As 3'our demand for raw\nI material becomes greater and greater\nas 3ou r population grows and 3011 turn\nmore, and moro to manufacturing, you\nmust in time lower that tariff wall iiud\ntake our raw material. This will make\nthe north and south traffic over 3011 r\nI railroads, that today is prncticallv\nnothing compared with what it must ho\n1 in time.\n1 \"The .'real lakes w iJi grow more and\nmoro in importance, cspecialh in re\ngard to its north and south traffic. To\nday the tonnage through the Soo'\ncanal more than doubles that of your\nlargest seaport, New York. Jfc will\nnever grow less, but constant- in\ncrease. Tho American thinks of tho\ngreat lakes as American private prop\nerty, but on second thought 3-011 peo\nple must realir.o that with the excep\ntion of Lake Michigan, the lakes be\nlong to Canada -just as much as they do\nto Die United States.\n\"When wo cut a sea canal through\nfrom Georgian Bav on the north side\nof Lake Huron to the St. Lawrence and\non to the Atlantic wo will have an all\nCanadian water route for small sea\ngoing vessels to the middle ol. the\n'North Americnn continent that the\nUnited States cannot hope to equal.\nAs The Tribune says, 'The Erie canal\nis tho basis of all railroad freight 111\nAmerica; ' and so this Canadian sea\nroute to tho head of Ijnke Superior will\nset 'the samo pace for the continent as\ntho Erie canal does now to the United\nStates.\nSecond Sea Route.\n\"Then we have a second sea route\nfor tho deepest vessel to the heart of\nthe North American continent in Hud\nson ;s Bav. True, it is crossed 1)3 ice\nseven months of the year, but so are\ntho great lakes closed by ico several\nmonths of the vear vet they do con\nsiderable businoss. The trafiic of the\nlakes is worth more to the United\nSlates toda3 both in tonnago and\nmonev, than tho trafiic of all her salt\nwatof ports on both oceans. Canada\ntakes two-fifths of your exports today,\nand will take more and more, both 111\nactual amount and in proportion. And\ntho great) lakes will figure hugely 111\nthis north and south trafiic.\n\"The United States ib a great coun\ntry, and Canada is a great country.;\nWhich will be the greater remains to\nbe seen. Jt will not do to jump at\nconclusions, as the avoragg American\ndoes, that America will be the greater.\nSoil, climate and people determine\nwhat a country will be. and Canada\nhas just as much and iust as good natu\nral resources as has the United States,\nand as for people we are alike. Wc\narc of tho same blood, the same lan\nguage and the samo laws those of Old\nEngland.\n\"Canada will never become a part\nof tho United States, and the Cnitcd\nStates does not want Canada, iu fact,\nboth countries are each too largo in\narea as it is. Tt is a question whether\neach can alwa-s remain as it is, as\ntimo goes on and 11103- become more\nthickly settled and adverse internal\ninterests arise in each bnscd on geo\ngraphical differences that no law can\ncover or adjust. All talk of one coun\ntr3 Canada and tho United States, is\nabsurd. It would bo as fatal to tho\nUnited States in the long run as to\nCanada.\n\".Canada and the United States have\ntoo maiiA things iu common and so few\nin opposition that they will alwu3s bo\nfriends. Asia is rising in the cast,\n'Asia for Asiatics,' and against this\ncompetition the United States needs\nCanada, and Canada, needs the United\nStales.

G. CATES\nPUTS BURDEN ON\nLEAST ABLE TO PAY\nHE agrarian group in the Canadian\nparliament, which represents both the\norganized farmers and labor, and\nwhich has a very large following\nthroughout the country, is opposed to\nthe sales tax as it is now being levied\nin Canada. Owing to the fact that the very heavy\nwar expenditure had rendered it necessary to im\npose heavy taxation, there was a strong disposition\non the part of all classes to give this method of\ntaxation a fair trial, for it was felt that all should\nbear a fair share of the burden. But in its latest\napplication, the tax, instead of spreading taxation\nover all classes in proportion to their ability to pay,\nis now being made the means whereby the war\ntaxes are being shifted from the backs of the well\nto-do to the backs of the mass of the people.\nBeing, for the most part, strong supporters of\nthe principle of direct, as opposed to indirect, taxa\ntion, there was also a disposition on the part of the\nleaders of the farmer group to give the sales tax\na fair trial on the ground that the collections would\ngo directly to the government but last year's tax\nof 1 per cent has this year been increased so that in\nthe aggregate it undoubtedly amounts to more like\na straight tax of 2 per cent. For in addition to a\n50 per cent increase on general sales, there has been\nintroduced a tax of 1 per cent additional on im\nports, so that the sales tax has really been used\nas a lever to raise the tariff.\nTo some of the best inform\ned of the agricultural leaders\nthe sales tax never did look\ngood, for it was manifestly a\nconsumption tax, and this tax\nalways weighs most heavily\nupon the great mass of the\npeople. They contended that\nit would place an additional\nobstacle in the way of trade\nat a time when every effort\nshould be made to remove such\nobstacles. Besides, it looked\ntoo much like an attempt\nto place taxation on the\nwrong spot. The very quarter\nfrom which the sales tax pro\nposals came made them sus\npicious.\nThese views have been more\nthan confirmed by the experi\nence of the/past year. Today\nthe Canadian sales tax stands\nclearly revealed as an attempt\nto lift the burden from the\nbacks of the wealthy and to\nplace it on those who are not\nnearly as able to pay. Besides,\nnot satisfied with a 1 per cent\nmeasure, which advocates of\nthe tax generally have insisted\nwould be more than sufficient\nto raise the large revenues re\nquired, an almost double dose\nhas now been administered.\nCanada's experience with\nthis tax has shown beyond all\nshadow of a doubt that even\nas a revenue producer it is a\nmuch overrated measure. Dur\ning the 11 months up to April\n30 that it has been in opera\ntion, it produced $40,000,000\nin revenue, but during the last\nsix months of this time the\ncollections fell from a little\nover $5,000,000 a month to less\nthan $2,900,000. Indeed, at\nthe time that the changes were\nmade in the tax it was only\nbringing in about $2,500,000 a\nmonth. One can just imagine\n-iiow far that would go towards\nI\nI VE BEEN PAYlNC.

The big business interests\nwant the excess profits taxes and cor\nporation taxes abolished and the sales\ntax substituted. The sales tax is op\nposed by farmer and labor organiza\ntions and progressives generally. The\nagitation for it by the special interests\nis bringing great pressure on congress,\nand it will be well for Leader readers\nto learn from Mr. Cates how it has\nworked out in Canada, and then\nwrite your congressman about it.\nmeeting an expenditure of nearly $600,000,000 a\nyear in Canada.\nThe failure of this tax as a revenue producer is\na feature that concerns the financier, the business\nman, the farmer and laborer. It is absolutely\nnecessary that any measure of taxation adopted\nshould bring in the money. If it does not do this\nthen, even if it has other features that would rec\nommend it, it should be ruled out. This is particu\nlarly true when it is proposed to let go certain taxes\nthat are bringing in vast sums of money and to\nAND NOW THE MILLERS ARE GETTING WISE\n1\nMILLS\nA well-known millers' publication during the war actually came out with the statement that\nthe millers were better off during the time the government abolished future trading than be\nfore. And now it is claimed that the milling interests have not joined the Chicago Board of\nTrade in the fight on the bills in the Illinois legislature intended to stop grain gambling. The\nmillers are beginning to question the gambling system of marketing grain that they have so\nlong supported. Every legitimate business should stand with the farmers in the\nstruggle to eliminate the vicious practices of the grain exchanges.\nPAGE TEN\nSAX,MR.

To date Canada's experience shows that if this\nis done the last state of the treasury will be worse\nthan the first.\nIt is in the interest of the people of the United\nStates that this feature of the situation should be\nknown, as some very glowing promises have been\nmade. Jules Bache of New York, one of the most\ninfluential of sales tax advocates, in April, 1920,\nwrote the following over his own signature in a\nspecial issue of his own \"Bache's Review\":\n\"If any such sum can be raised, as would appear\nprobable, predicted on the figures submitted, all in\ncome taxes of $5,000 or less would become unneces\nsary, and a nominal tax on all other incomes would\nbe sufficient. Today an income of $5,000 pays be\ntween $120 and $160. Under the new tax, if it is\nexpended in toto for the purchase of commodities,\nthe income of $5,000 would pay a tax of $50, as\nsuming that every article purchased has had the\ntax added and the consumer has had to pay it. But\non many articles the tax is so small that it is ab\nsorbed or paid by the seller out of his normal profits\nand not added to the purchase price.\"\nSTATEMENT IS DISPROVED\nBY FACTS IN CANADA\nIt would be well for the American public to un\nderstand that nothing like this has happened in\nCanada. When the sales tax was introduced last year\nnot only was the income tax not reduced, but the\nexemptions on it were not extended. On the con\ntrary, the tax on incomes of $5,000 was somewhat\nincreased. This year, when the\ntax was very considerably in\ncreased, there was not the\nslightest change made in the\nincome tax. If the claims\nmade respecting this tax were\nvalid, then what has been\npromised by its advocates in\nthe United States should have\ntaken place in Canada. It has\nworked out that the average\nCanadian not only pays all\nthe income taxes he ever did,\nand a new tax, that on sales.\nBut those who are making a\ngreat deal of money out of\nbusiness have fared much bet\nter. In Canada the business\nprofits tax has been repealed,\nand to make up for the loss of\nthis revenue the sales tax has\nbeen increased. In other words,\nthe mass of the people, the\nfarmers and workingmen, are\nbeing called upon very largely\nto make up for what the others\nhave escaped. It requires no\nargument to demonstrate that\nthe business profits tax as\nlevied in Canada was not as\ngreat a hardship on those who\npaid it as the sales tax is to\nthe average person. The busi\nness house paid it only on\nprofits above 10 per cent but\nthe sales tax is paid by the\npeople who spend nearly all\nthey make in order to buy\nfood, clothing and the general\nnecessities of life. Take the\nbusiness house again, it only\npaid the business profits tax\nwhen it made money, but it\nhas to pay the sales or turn\nover whether it makes money\nor not.\nIt is this unfair feature, this\nshifting of the burden from the\nbacks of those well able to pay\nto the backs of those who have\nall they can do to make ends\nmeet, that has aroused strong\nopposition among the farmers\nthis year.

In\ntact, it is not long: since a great American\nwriter, in n article on the \"Wheat Supply\nof Europe and America,\" made the state\nment that to the north of the international\nboundary there is only a narrow fringe\nof land capable of producing wheat. In\nreplying to this, another writer, better\ninformed as to facts, said that wheat could\nbo successfully grown at Fort Simpson, a\nHudson's Bay company's post lying at the\nJunction of the Laird and Mackenzie\nrivers, near the intersection of longitude\n122 degrees west and latitude 62 degrees\nnorth, or nearly 800 miles north oi the\nboundary line between the United States\nand Canada, and as far northwest of\nWinnipeg (the metropolis of western Can\nada) as Winnipeg is northwest of New\n.York. Not only is it possible to raise\nwheat at this degree of latitude, and that\nof a better quality than it is possible to\ngrow in any other country, but 200 miles\nnorth of that point, rye and oats are\ngrown whilst 200 miles still farther north\nbarley and potatoes are successfully pro\nduced.\n279,000 Square Mllea.\n! In speaking of the extent of the country\nInferred to in these pages, one writer\ncays: \"Leaving out the 400,000 square\nmiles of Keewatin, the 382,000 square\nmiles of British Columbia, with its untold\nwealth of forests, fisheries and mines, and\nAthabasca, with its area of 122,000 square\nmiles, we have left, then, Manitoba and\nthe districts of Assiniboia. Alberta and\nSaskatchewan, extending 400 miles north\nand south, and 900 miles east and west,\nand embracing an area of 359,000 square\nmiles. If we draw a line through Harper's\nFerry, from the northern boundary of\nPennsylvania to the southern line of Vir\nginia, and take all west of that line to\nthe Missouri river, embracing part of the\nStates named and all of West Virginia,\nOhio, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri\nand Iowa, we shall have an American ter\nritory equal in extent and area, and in no\nwise' superior in agricultural resources,\nto the Canadian territory under Considera-\ntion!\"\nA recent writer, resident in. Sweden,:\ngives an idea of the size of Canada by\nmaking the following comparison: \"Can\nada is, in brief, as large as the whole of\nIpurope.\"\nIn Canada there are 279,000 square miles\nOf land not surpassed in fertility by any\narea of similar size on the face of the\nglobe, most of which is embraced in what\nIs here described as western Canada.\nRailways.\n: Railways nowadays are a prime es\nsential to a good grain market. The sev\neral systems of railways operating in\nwestern Canada supply a service that is\nreallv excellent. Nearly every farming\ndistrict is within easy access of one of the\nlines of railway, while branches are be\ning extended as the conditions of settle\nment demand. It is estimated that witn\nthe projected lines and branches of the\nCanadian Pacific, the Manitoba & North\nwestern, the Great North West Central,\nand Canadian Northern through the Sas\nkatchewan river belt, and which at an\nearly date will become a second trans\ncontinental line through that great coun\ntry Calgary and Edmonton, Regina,\nPrince Albert and Long Lake, the neces\nsities of new settlers are, well met. There\nfore, while it is possible, in some cases,\nthat in order to secure the advantage of\nfree homesteads it may be necessary to\ngo some little distance from the railway,\nthe policy of the government and railroads\nIs to push forward the construction of\ncolonization lines, so that in a very short\ntime even these new setlements will have\nthe advantage of railway facilities. Com\npetition between the different lines is re\nlied upon to improve rates from time to\ntime, and in some cases rates are regu\nlated by act of parliament. The exten\nsion of railways in western Canada dur\ning the past few years has been one of the\nmost strongly marked features of the\nprogress of the country. The Canadian\nPacific railway crosses this country with\nIts iron belt, running through to the Pa\ncific ocean, the prairies of Manitoba As\nsiniboia, Alberta and Saskatchewan being\na great fertile link connecting eastern\nCanada with the rich Province of British\nColumbia, with its mines and untolU\nwealth in lumber and fisheries, as well as\nconsiderable stretches of excellent agri\ncultural lands, while the Canadian North\nSri as previously intimated, w 11 have a\nAstern practically paralleling it through\nbne of the most fertile grain and grazing\ndistricts on the continent. These and the\nother railways mentioned have opened up\na large tract of fertile land in Manitoba\n2nd the northwest, ready for the plow\n2nd considered to be the largest wheat\nerowing area in the world.\n' The splendid Saskatchewan valley has\nbeen opened recently by two new lines\nJvth*r are projected, including one in the\nErection of Hudson's bay, in anticipation\nS e route between Hudson's traits^nd\nLiverpool becoming available. The can\nadTan Pacific railway's lines n southern\nManitoba and eastern Assiniboia have\naX? been extended, securing the opening\ntfttie ISuris coal fields and an ununited.\nSunolv of cheap fuel to the settlers. Not\nJnfy have the people of Manitoba connec\ntion with the Pacific ocean and with\nastern Canada through British territory,\n2nd Scess to the great lakes, but there\n2?e also three lines running to the United\nHates boundary, joining there the Amer\nican system of railways.\n\" forests.\n' The forests of Canada are rich with a,\nfcrtit variety of trees which are useful\n^ lumber of .many kinds, for building\nSuTJoses. for furniture, and,.- in many\nSarts of Canada, for fuel. Among the va\nrieties are the maple, elm. ash. Douglas\nfir Alaska cedar, spruce, balsam, red\ncedar, hemloqk. walnut, oak, butternut,\nbasswood, poplar, chestnut, mountain ash,\n- willow, black and white birch and others.\nFuel.\n* Besides the large tracts of forest, both\nSn and adjacent to Manitoba, there are\ncoal areas within and contiguous to the\n' province of such extent as to be practically\n' inexhaustible. It has been discovered that\nbetween Red river and the Rocky Moun\ntains there are some 65,000 square miles\n0f coal bearing strata. The principal\nfarming districts of western Canada are\nwithin easy reach of firewood, while the\ntermer of Alberta, Assiniboia,. and Sas\nkatchewan is specially favored, on ac\ncount of his '-'- x able to go to the banks\npf the rivers - d. from there get all the\ncoal he requires, in some cases at the bafe\npost of handling and hauling it home. Ex\ntensive collieries are now operated at Can\nmore, Lethbridge, Edmonton and Anthra-?\ncite in Alberta, and at many other points\nSmall mines are worked for the immediate\nwants of the settlers. The coal mined at\nthe first three of the abovo-mentioned\npoints is bituminous, while that at the\n^fift i'\nTHTTRSDAY EVENING,\nlatter, sm Indicated by the name. Is an\nthracite and of first quality. Coal is also\nmined in southeastern Assiniboia, and,\nalthough of the lignite family, makes fairly\ngood fuel.\"'\nThe legislature of Manitoba has effected\nan arrangement which this coal is to be\nsupplied at a rate not to exceed $2.50 to $5\nper ton, according to locality. With the\nextraordinary transportation facilities\npossessed here, controlled and regulated\nas far as possible by the legislature, and\nwith enormous deposits of excellent coal,\neasily and inexpensively available, Mani\ntoba enjoys most exceptional advantages,\nsecuring an ample and cheap supply for all\nher inhabitants.\nIn western Canada the rate, of taxation\nis low it is only a few cents per acre,\nwhere the settlers do not impose burdens\non themselves, and under all circum\nstances is but a fraction of that in other\nparts of the continent and in Europe.\nIn Manitoba the subsidies received\namount to about $2 per capita. Conse\nquently the provincial government taxes\nbut lightly for Its annual expenditure. A\nlarge portion of the revenue so derived\ngoes to support schools, roads and bridges,\nagricultural societies for the benefit of the\nfarmers, the maintenance of asylums and\nother public institutions for the care of the\nafflicted The farmer is taxed to only half\nthe extent of the amount raised by tax\nation in the United States.\nIn Manitoba the reeve and six councilors\ntransact the business of a municipality.\nThey levy and collect taxes, form and re\nadjust school districts, . and build, con\nstruct, and repair roads and bridges. Low\ntaxation is the rule all through western\nCanada, and that is an important item.\nThe stock, implements,' household goods,\nand all other personal effects belonging to\nthe settler, as well as farm buildings and\nother Improvements, are exempt. In this\nway in Manitoba the average taxes for all\npurposes will not exceed $12 for a quarter\nsection. In Assiniboia, Alberta, and Sas\nkatchewan they will not average more\nthan $5 or $6 per quarter section.\nThe average yield of wheat varies un\nder different conditions. In some years\nthe average has been over thirty bushels\nper acre, while in others it' has been\ntwenty-five, and in one or two years going\nas low as sixteen and eighteen bushels.\nMany individual cases report as high as\nforty-five and even fifty-five bushels to\nthe acre. But taking the lowest average,\nand with reasonable prices, there is no\nIndustry that will produce better profits.\nFor years past the price of wheat all over\nthe world has been low, but the farmers\nfrom year to year have enlarged their\nwheat areas. Owing to the modern and\neconomical methods employed in crop\nping, harvesting, threshing and market-\nTaxation.\nAverage Yield of Wheat.\nOne of Ohio's able writers, who recently took a trip through Western Can-\nada, speaks thus: \"The Red River is crossed Just before reaching Winnipeg*\nFew rivers In all the world drain a richer and more fertile country. It Is\ndoubted If any other river In the world has so much productive wheat land tribu-\ntary to It. Wherever it flows, prosperity and plenty, agricultural richness and\nthe bounty of Ceres seem to go and remain. On every hand from Winnipeg\nwest several hundred miles, wheat fields almost as level as the floor extend as\nfar as the eye can reach. , Most of the fields were still standing In the sheaf\nand regiment after regiment of the golden grain in the shock feasted the eye.\nThat this Is a prosperous section hardly needs proof other than a view of the\ngreat stretch of wheat land and the harvested grain.\nBut the large and attractive farmhouses, with frequently immense barns,\nand Improvements of every nature, modern and substantial, speak most elo-\nquently of the wealth of the section. At many places cutting the grain was\nstill going on. Great harvesters were at work, a dozen of them at a time, one\nfollowing the other, cutting an Immense swath every time they passed. Grain\ndrills, harvesters and binders are In their element and are aiding nature and\nman to produce marvelous yields every year and develoo and build up an im-\nmense area, perhaps unexcelled In all the world. Immense grain elevators tower\nabove their surroundings, as if watching the fair lartd, and jealous of their\ncharge.\"\ning, as well as the special ease with which\nIn this prairie country of western Canada\nall this is accomplished, there is always\na profit. The cost of raising an acre of\nwheat being placed by experts at from\n$5 to $7 per acre, there have been cases\nin the past few years where as much as\n$25 per acre has been realized as a profit,\nwhile in many cases it is safe to put the\nprofit at from $10 to $15 per acre. With\nwheat at its present price, and with the\nprospect of gQod prices for some time to\ncome, it does not require much demon\nstration to the practical mind to realize\nthat the wealth of western Canada is not\naltogether confined to the gold fields of\nthe Yukon and British Columbia.\n\"Phenomenal Wheat-Growing Capabili\nties\" Is a term that is sometimes applied\nto western Canada by American news\npapers and while there is no desire on\nthe part of the writer to make so high\nsounding a claim, it is not wholly in\napplicable when the average growth of\nwheat in many of the states of the union\nis compared with the wheat crop of west\nern Canada. The late United States Con\nsul Taylor, in one of his reports from\nWinnipeg, stated as follows:\n\"When harvest time came, the entire\nlabor of the region was found to be\nwholly inadequate for the task before it.\nThe wheat straw had grown so tall and\nstout, and was so heavily loaded down\nwith grain, as to make the work of reap\ning and stacking extremely exhausting.\nThe strength and weight of the growing\ngrain frequently broke the reaping ma\nchines, and the utmost exertion of strong\nmen was required to handle the great\nWeight of the sheaves.\" During harvest\ntime it become necessary to 'bring into\nthe country from fourteen to fifteen thou\nsand harvest hands fro mthe eastern\nprovinces of Canada to assist in garner\ning the immense harvest of grains.\nOats, Barley and Flax.\nWhile \"wheat Is king\" it is not the\" only\ncereal grown. The crops of oats, barley,\nand peas are wonderful, and the growth\nprodigious. As will he seen from the re\nports of delegates who have visited the\ncountry, what they saw was a revelation to\nthem. Oats yielded all the way from sixty\nto ninety bushels per acre., and in some\nca3es have been known, to exceed a ahun\ndred. One delegate writes: \"One hun\ndred bushels of oats and sixty bushels\nof barley per acre were common crops on\nwell tilled farms, and individual yields of\n85 bushels of barley and 124 of oats were\nwell authenticated. I brought back with\nme, arid still have, a sample of oats for\nWhich a yield per acre so phenomenal was,\nclaimed that I do not care to give the\nfigures, but the specimen has character\nistics which would make it remarkable,\nwhether the yield were two bushels or two\nhundred. The' grain stood five feet six\ninches high, the heads were more than\ntwelve inches long,, and each chaff case\nwhen opened is found to'Contain not one or\ntwo but three, perfect kernels of oats.\"\nBarley, as has been said, yields enor\nmously. Owing to the bright sunshine\nand the absence of rain during harvest it\npresents a bright appearance and is sought\nafter by brewers everywhere, .bringing\nA PARADISE LITTLE UNDERSTOOD.\nseveral cents a bushel more than that\ngrown in other countries. Peas yield\nsplendidly, and are entirely free from grubs\nand bugs. They are used in fattening\nhogs\nanyd\nfor\ninv\never way to Expert s say that\nthe absence of hog cholera in this country\nis largely attributable to the excellent\nfeed, corn not being used. It must not\nbe thought from this that corn can not be\ngrown, but wheat pays so much better that\nbut little attention is given to it. How\never, a number of farmers raise corn for\nthe purpose of fodder and use as ensilage.\nSome of it grows as high as ten and twelve\nfeet.\nThe results of experimental tests of va\nrieties of grain, to gain information as to\ntheir relative productiveness and useful\nness, are much more reliable as a guide to\nthe selection of the best sorts when the\naverage experience of several years can\nbe given. With regard to the yield of cer\neals a few figures may' not be \"out 'of\nplace. There is an experimental farm in\nManitoba and another in the Northwest\nTerritories.\nIn oats, in a three years' continuous\ntest -at the Manitoba farm, the average\nyield, with twelve different varieties\nsown, was 75, bushels 20 pounds to the\nacre at the experimental farm in the\nNorthwest Territories the average was 85\nbushels 23 pounds per acre.\nIn two-rowed barley, with six varieties,\nthe average yield at the Manitoba farm\nfor three years was 42 bushels 31 pounds\nper acre in the Northwest Territories'\nfarm the average was 56 bushels 26 pounds\nper acre.\nIn spring wheat, twelve varieties, the\naverage yield in Manitoba was 35 bushels\n28 pounds per acre in the Territories, 41\nbushels 41 pounds per acre.\nIn potatoes, the average yield from\ntwelve varieties during the three years\nwas 343 bushels 50 pounds per acre in\nManitoba in the Territories, 300 bush\nels 15 pounds per acre. These averages\nfor three years cannot be surpassed any\nwhere.'\nRoots and Vegetables.\nApropos of roots and vegetables, it is\nadmitted by all who have any knowledge\nof the matter, that in the growth of these\nproducts Western Canada has no superior.\nIn the middle of September ripe tomatoes\nmay be seen in great profusion, while they\nhave been known to ripen as early as the\nfirst of July. A gentleman from Ohio\nvisiting one of the agricultural fairs, said\nhe had never seen anything in his .state\nequal the exhibit. Thtee cabbages weighed\ntogether 126 pounds, solid, -sound and fine\ngrained as though they had weighed but\nsix pounds each. Prize potatoes weighed'\n4% pounds each, while those weighing\nthree pounds were so plentiful that they\nattracted ro attention. Beets, carrots,\nturnips, eta, also grow to an exception\nally large size watermelons reach 75\npounds and citrons 25 pounds. *\nDairying.\nWith regard to dairying, the season just\npast has in many respects been an im\nprovement on its predecessors. There\n40,000 BONA FIDE SETTLERS IN A YEAR.\nCanadian hard wheat is of the best quality produced in the world, and three-fourths of the. hard\nwheat area lies north of the 49th paraUeL /,\nTwenty-seven thousand Americans, who expressed their intention of becoming settlers, crossed\nthe border into Western Canada during the first eight months of the present year. Immigration offi-\ncials say the number entering Canada as bona fide settlers this year will be between 35,000 and 40,000.\nThe number of immigrants officially recorded as entering Western Canada during the first eight\nmonths of 1902 was 52,860. An official estimate of the total number who will come in during the\nyear is 65,000. ' .,._.*...\"\nShrewd Americans have been the largest Investors in land in Western Canada. One company\nalone purchased a million and a half acres, which is now being rapidly settled by experienced farmers.\nIt requires an army of over 20,000 harvesters from Eastern Canada to help gather in the crops\nof the Canadian West every year. Forty thousand men will not be able to cope with the western har-\nvests in a few years.\n' A conservative estimate of the income of the farmers of Western Canada this year, places it at\n$50,000,000. About 08,000,000 bushels of wheat will be threshed, and 60)000,000 will be exported..\nnrnffim\n^ THE MiNNEAPOLIS JOUENAL.\nothecorn.\nr feed, and are superior\nAverage Crops..,\n: *\"- C''.iu\nGUNNING FOE CANADA LANDS\n*\n/*\nEvery Shot Brings Results.\nhas been a good market for choice cream\nery butter throughout the summer, and\nits average prices realized have been\nsomewhat ip advance of previous years.\nThe attached table shows a large increase\nin the quantity of the butter manufactured\nat nearly ail the creameries mentioned,\nand judging by the present prospects, we\nmay look for further substantial increases\nin the future. The season's butter was\nall sold and shipped to the westto points\nin British Columbia, China, Japan, and\nthe Yukon Territory. The butter shipped\nto the three last named places was packed\ninto sealed tins, holding 10, 5, 2, and 1\npound each.\nWhile the result is a g ratifying one, it\nmust be admitted, at the same time, that\nthere is _ yet a great deal of room for im\nprovement. Considering the number of\npeople, who are engagedwin dairy farming\nin Alberta, and the number of milch cows\nkept, the average production is yet very\nsmall.\nDairying is a specially. Important indus\ntry in wfstern Canad^and year after year\nis assuming greater proportions. The\nmarket is an excellent one, and the ad\nvantages of the government creameries\nare fully proved. In Alberta there are\ncreamery stations at the f ololvving, ppints:\nCalgary, Innisfail, \"Red Deer, Tindastoil,\nWetaskiwin and Edmonton. [During 1898\nthe output was 164^88 pounds in 1899,\n241,328 pounds in 1900, 303,771. In the\neastern'diyisloft*^\nat Churchbridge, Gxenfell, Moose Jaw,\nMoosomin, Prince \"Albert, Qu' Appelle,\nRegina, Saltcoats, Saskatoon, Whitewood,\nWolsely, and Yorkton, the amount for 1899\nwas 252,658, that for, 1900 being 333,221,\nmaking a total in the territories of 501,907\npounds in 1899, and 636,998 pounds in 1900.\nIn Manitoba dairying, is an exceedingly\nprofitable industry. This season's butter\nwas all sold and shipped to the west to\npoints in British Columbia, China, Japan\nand the Yukon.] There can be no good\nreason why winter dairying should not be\nfollowed up extensively in northern Al\nberta. The nature of the soil and climate\nis favorable for growing an abundance of\nfeed for the stock during the winter, and\nthere is also sufficient timber to enable\nthe settlers to build comfortable stables\nfor their milking stock.\nFruits.\nWild fruits, such as strawberries, rasp\nberries, saskatoons, black currants, goose\nberries, grapes, plums, cherries and\ncranberries, grow in abundance. in\ncultivated fruits there are straw\nberries, raspberries, currants, goose\nberries and crab apples. While\nthe standard varieties are brought to a\nreasonable degree of perfection in some\ndistricts, crab apples are grown with\nconsiderable success, while the smaller\nfruits are grown even more successfully\nthan in many parts of the east, and in\npoint of flavor .they are greatly superior.\nThe old adage and advice, not to put\nall the eggs iri one basket, applies to\nfarming in western Canada as well as\nelsewhere, and the farmer who not only\nraises wheat, but grows other grains, and\nhas around him his herds of cattle, hogs,\nsheep and poultry, is near the achieve\nment of success as it is possible to get.\nHorses and cattle thrive remarkably well\non the prairie farms of western Canada,\nand in proportion to the number kept\nthere is probably more high-class stock\nthere than in any other part of America.\nSome of the most valuable stallions are\nto be found there, very many of which are\ndirect importations from Europe. Cattle\nin increasing numbers are to be met with\nall over the prairie. Almost every class\nof fine-bred cattle is to be seen, among\nwhich may be mentioned Shorthorns, Gal\nloways, Polled Angus, Herefords, Jerseys\nand Holsteins. The export of beef cat\ntle is very large, and owing to the demand\nin the mining districts of British Colum\nbia and the Yukon previously mentioned,\nthere is a splendid home market. Usually\ncattle are fed on the wild prairie hay,\nwhich in most parts grows in great abun\ndance. It is generally acknowledged that\nboth cattle and horses prefer and thrive\nbetter on wild prairie grass than on cul\ntivated varieties. The quality of the beef\nis the richest, and under the circumstan\nces the cost of production is reduced to\na minimum. Not infrequently an animal\nMi\n1 \\ute*mt v\"*'^-\nMixed Farming.\nwhose total cost did not exceed more than\na few dollars realizes from $30 to $50. In\nmany sections of the country, where there\nis a considerable quantity of wood, cattle\nand sometimes horses are kept out of\ndoors all winter. In fact, in some parts\nof Saskatchewan, Assiniboia and Alberta\ncattle are prepared for market that have\nnever seen the inside of a stable. On\nmost Manitoba farms they are stabled\nfrom about the middle or end of Novem\nber to the middle or end of March. In\nsome Instances they are turned out and\nallowed to run In the yards and \"rustle\"\naround the straw stacks.\nAs regards the prices realized for live\nstock this year, they have fluctuated very\nlittle. The export markets opened at\nabout 4^c off cars Winnipeg, and has\nranged from that price down to 3%c for\nchoice steers. For a while in the spring\nas high as 5c was being paid for stall-fed\nanimals for local consumption, owing to\nfears of scarcity. Stocker cattle sold at\nfrom $12 to $16 per head for yearlings, $18\nto $22 for 2-year-olds. Most of the year\nlings realized $14.50 per head. For sheep\nthe market, opened at from 5c to 5%c and\nhas ranged from these figures down to 4c,\nand for hogs the market has ranged from\n4%c to 5c, selected weights. Horses have\nbeen selling throughout the season at from\n$125 to $175 each for working grades.\nPrices for Canadian cattle at Liverpool\nranged throughout the season- from, lQJc\nto 12c per pound, estimated dressed\nweight.

Thus far American immigrants are largely In excess of\nthose from other lands, outside the British groups, and American thought will\nhave a mighty influence In molding the character of the coming common-\nwealths of Western Canada.\n\"The English speaking Immigrants outnumber many fold all those of\nother tongues and thus It Is made sure that both the great republic and\nthe nascent nation adjoining will be loyal to the idea of constitutional liberty,\nand, standing side by sjde, will work together to advance that Anglo-Saxon\ncivilization which seems destined to dominate the world.\"\nin sheep and horses was also carried on,\nin addition to the cattle trade.\nSheep.\nIn many parts of western Canada there\nare large sheep ranches, it having been\nfound that this country is peculiarly\nadapted to sheep raising.

The figures\ngiven above look large, but they are right.\nThey were furnished by C. N. Bell, sec\nretary of the Winnipeg Grain exchange,\nwho based and compiled them on facts\nand figures obtained from the most re\nliable sources. Mr. Bell, when giving out\nthis latest estimate on the crops of west\nern Canada for 1902, said: \"I never make\nguesses. The wheat yield of the Cana\ndian west this year will be almost 68,000.-\n000 bushels. Deducting from this the\namount used for seeding, and for local\nconsumption, and the farmers are left\nwith 60,000,000 bushels or over for ex\nport. My figures are based on an experi\nence of seventeen years in the business,\ndata in my hands, and on previous results.\nThe estimate can be considered a broad\none, and while the figures are approxi\nmate, I believe that they will tally closely\nwith the inspection returns.\"\nLast year when western Canada raised\nover 63,000,000 bushels of wheat from\n2,500,000 acres of land, farmers in the\nUnited States and eastern Canada were\nalmost incredulous. They had for years\nconsidered the plains of western, Canada\na wilderness, which had not been tested\nby the agriculturalist, and which in their\nminds comprised at the best but an Im\nmense territory sparsely populated. They\nheeded not the words of practical econom\nists who years ago said that these same\nplains would some day be the huge gran\nary of the continent. But the good news\ngot abroad. The government, or official\nfigures, on the record crops of 1901 were\npublished, and in time reached the farm\ners of nearly every state in. the union,\nof Great Britain, and as a matter of\ncourse of eastern Canada.\nThousands of farmers anxious to better\ntheir condition began to make inquiries\nabout a country which would give a yield\nof twenty-five bushels of wheat, forty\nbushels of barley and forty-eight bushels\nof oats, per acre as an average. None\nwere more keen than the American farm\ner, who, not satisfied with the literature\non the country obtained from Dominion\nand provincial immigration officials, vis\nited the country personally and verified\nthe published reports. 'In this manner did.\nthe American invasion of Western Canada\ncommence.\nto the New England Magazine,\nWestern Canada, as has been truly said,\nwas made by her record crops in 1901. The\nresult was shown early . this year in the\ntrain loads of homeseekers and investors\nwho spread over the country, spying out\nthe land, and seldom leaving without\neither purchasing or homesteading. \"Can\nthe remarkable performance of 1901 be\nrepeated by the country in 1902?\" was\nthe question then asked. The latest re\nturns to hand and the estimates of con\nscrvative, experienced men, show that it\nhas been more than repeated. It has\nbeen eclipsed.\nManitoba, with 2,039,940 acres devoted\nto raising wheat, will this year give\nyield of about 54,000,000 bushels of that\ncereal. This estimate is made by an of\nficial from the latest reutrns, and is con\nsidered conservative. The average yield\nper acre he puts at twenty-seven bushels,\nor an increase of two bushels an acre over\nthe yield of 1901. The September 1902\ncrop bulletin issued by the government of\nthe Northwest Territories, which includes\nAssiniboia, Saskatchewan and Alberta,\nstates that, with a wheat area of 685,576\nacres, the yield of that cereal this year\nwill be 14,649,500 bushels. The yield of\noats will amount to 10,725,500 bushels and\nof barley 844,000 bushels.\nm-\nHow 1902 Excels.\nThe remarkable success that crowned\nthe efforts of Western Canada farmers\nlast year, and the influx of new settlers,\nresulted this year in a largely increased\nacreage in both Manitoba and the terri\ntories. The following official figures are\ngiven for Manitoba: Increase in area un\nder wheat, 28,105 acres oats, 35,109 acres\nbarley, 138,781 acres flax, 20,222 acres. In\nthe territories the^wheat acreage increased\n80,879 acres oats, 50,374 acres and bar\nley, 6,320 acres.\nWith the increased acreage the people\nof Western Canada were confident that the\ncrops of last year would be repeated. Few\nthought, however, that they would be\neclipsed, and the figures just compiled on\nthe crop of 1902 are.a surprise even to\npeople who have lived in the country for\nmany years. The crops of 1901 and 1902.\nand the resulting Immigration, are to\nmark an epoch in Canada's history.\nWestern Canada has awakened to find\nthe eyes of the world upon her. The\ncrop this-year is the greatest proportionate\nto acreage ever grown on unfertilized land.\nAverage of 27 Bushels.\nThe average yield of grain in Western\nCanada has, with the .exception of 1900.\nwhen the crop conditions were disappoint\ning, always been high. Most of the pro\nduction of wheat in 1901 and 1902 came\nfrom Manitoba, but the official returns\nfrom the territories . just to hand, show\nthat the districts to the west, which are\nnow being settled by thousands of Ameri\ncans, are capable of the same results. The\naverage yield of wheat per acre in these\ndistricts is given officially this year as a\nlittle over twenty-five bushels. This same\nsoil has to its credit for a period of ten\nyears an average yield of 19.92 bushels of\nwheat. Not since 1895 has theh yield of\nwheat in Manitoba created so much sur\nprise as it has this year. In that year\nthe average was 28 bushels. Last year\nit was 25 and this year it will average 27.\nReports of astonishing yields in certain\n** ':':**A %\nsections of the west have been recently\nreceived by the provincial department of\nagriculture. One farmer wrote that his\nyield was 48 bushels to the acre. Reports\nof yields ranging from 28 to 35 bushels an\nacre were quite common in the most fa\nvored district of Manitoba.\nHustle All Along the Line.\nThat the returns of grain production\nfrom the west will surprise many goes\nwithout saying. Canadians themselves,\nparticularly those residing in the east,\nwill be as much surprised as their Ameri\ncan cousins. They have been slow to ac\ncept the rich possibilities of western Can\nada, which has in consequence been devel\noping gradually. They have always ap\npreciated the productiveness of the soil,\nbut not until last year, when the official\nreturns of the increased acreage and of\nthe bumper crops were made public, did\nthey realize fully the wealth that is com\ning from the mighty region that stretches\nwest from the Red river valley to the\nRocky mountains, north beyond the Sas\nkatchewan and northwest into the Peace\nriver valley.\nThe people of western Canada, and the\ngovernment, railroad and immigration of\nficials are willing to confess now that the\nenormous crops of last year also made\nthem involuntary participants in the gen\neral surprise party. All had a strenuous\nexperience in harvesting and housing the\ncrop. Twenty thousand men from the\neast entered the harvest fields and worked\nfor three months, and machinery and the\nnecessary material poured into the grain\ndistricts as fast as they could be secured,\nbut still there was the inevitable grain\nblockade.\nThis year, when it was ascertained that\nthe crops would be large, every prepara\ntion possible was made for handling them.\nBut with a harvest that exceeded all ex\npectations, another strenuous experience\nwas experienced by all concerned, and\nthe operations will extend in many dis\ntricts away into the winter.\nTwenty Full Regiments Crossed to\nCanada in 1902.\n\\**^\"'*&Kr**>-**s^\nNo Grain Blockade.\nAccording to C. C. Castle. Dominion\nwarehouse commissioner, who has just re\nturned from Fort William, where he in\nspected the arrangements made for the\nhandling of *he wheat output, there,- is\nno danger of a grain blockade this year,\nnotwithstanding the record crop. In an\ninterview he said:\n\"I do not see why there should be any\ngrain blockade. In fact, the conditions\ncould not be better than at present. By\nthe time navigation closes the elevator ca\npacity at Fort William will be sufficient to\ntake care of an enormous amount of\nwheat, and the capacity at country points\nis far in excess of last year.\"\nWheat Not All.\nOne of the first questions asked by the\naverage American who comes to western\nCanada is, \"Do you grow anything here\nbesides wheat?\" The question is an\nswered by referring the new settler to the\ngovernment returns of last year. These\nshow that Manitoba alone devcted 940,000\nacres to coarse grains in 1901, and 34,600\nacres to roots and potatoes. In the terri\ntories about the same proportion was\nseeded to these products. According to\nthe official crop bulletin of the territories\njust issued, the acreage for oats alone was\nincreased by 50,374 acres. The average an\nacre is given at a little over forty bushels,\nand the quality is the best. The increase\nin area under oats in Manitoba this year\nis 35,109 acres, and the average an acre\nwill be about forty-five bushels. Western\nCanada has for eighteen years had an\naverage yield of oats of thirty-four bush\nels to the acre. Perhaps in no country\nin the world has there been such surpris\ning yields of oats as in certain sections\nof the Canadian West in recent years. In\n1899 it is recorded that at. Brandon the\nyield reached an average of 120 bushels to\nthe acre.\nAwakening of Western Canada.\nThe following figures for 1902 were ob\ntained from the most experienced and\nconservative grain men and officials in\nthe west: Wheat, Manitoba. 2,039,:'40\nacres, averaging twenty-seven bushels per\nacre, 55,070,680 bushels. Territories (gov\nernir^nt estimate), 585,576 acres, yielding\n1J,O49,500 bushels total, 69,765,180 bushels.\nOats, Manitoba. 725,060 acres, averaging\nforty bushels per acre, 28,002,400 bushels.\nTerritories, (government estimate). 276,-\n942 acres, yielding 10,725.500 bushels to\ntal, 38.727,900 bushels. Barley, Manitoba.\n329,790 acres, averaging forty bushels per\nacre. 13,191,600 bushels. Territories, (gov\nernment estimate), 30,022 acres, yielding\n844.000 bushels total, 14.055,600 bushels.\nTwo bumper crops have completed the\nawakening of western Canada. Land val\nues are increasing all over the west, but\nthe figures on the crops of last year and\nthe present are told loudly to the pros\npective settler, and it will be only a mat\nter of a few years before the west country\nlying between the Red River valley and\nthe Rockies and away to the north, will\nbe peopled with thousands where now\nthere are hundreds.\n\"THE AMERICAN INVASION\"\nThe official record at the Dominion im\nmigration office in Winnipeg shows that\nin the rush to western Canada during the\nfirst eight months of 1902. 52,860 new set\ntlers were received, of whom 20,000 wera\nAmericans.\nDominion Immigration Commissioner\nSmith says that between 35,000 and 40,000\nAmericans will settle in his country in\n1902.\nEighty-five per cent of the settlers from\nthis side of the line are men, and most\nof them are buying land.\nNearly every state in the union ha\ncontributed to the rush to western Can\nada this year.\nAn official estimate states that 100,000\nnew settlers will come to western Canada\nnext year. The number this year will M\n65,000.\nBENHAM'S PHILOSOPHY.\nPhiladelphia Ledger.\nMrs. BenhamMother is\nBenhamNo, she isn't.\nMrs. BenhamWhat do you mean?\nBenhamWhatever is, is right,\n**Y VI *\n't *-'\n250,000\n$50,300,000\nI&&&M-", "batch": "mnhi_bena_ver02", "title_normal": "minneapolis journal.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045366/1902-11-13/ed-1/seq-12.json", "place": ["Minnesota--Hennepin--Minneapolis"], "page": "12"}, {"sequence": 11, "county": ["Mahoning", "Allegheny", "Allegheny"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Weekly (except the second week in July and the week after Thanksgiving)", "id": "/lccn/sn84024547/1955-03-23/ed-1/seq-11/", "subject": ["Allegheny County (Pa.)--Newspapers.", "Croatian Americans--Pennsylvania--Allegheny--Newspapers.", "Croatian Americans.--fast--(OCoLC)fst00883782", "Croats--United States--Newspapers.", "Croats.--fast--(OCoLC)fst00883833", "Mahoning County (Ohio)--Newspapers.", "North Side (Pittsburgh, Pa.)--Newspapers.", "Ohio--Mahoning County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01207166", "Ohio--Youngstown.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01213545", "Pennsylvania--Allegheny County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01209250", "Pennsylvania--Pittsburgh--North Side.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01322947", "Pennsylvania--Pittsburgh.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01205171", "Pittsburgh (Pa.)--Newspapers.", "United States.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204155", "Youngstown (Ohio)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Youngstown", "Allegheny", "Pittsburgh"], "date": "19550323", "title": "Zajednic\u030car = Fraternalist.

Rezultati te\nkampanje objelodanjeni su u slu\u017ebenom glasilu po\u010detkom\ngodine. \u010cetiri graditelja Zajednice, i to George Bali\u0107, Vin\ncent Bi.\u0161kupi\u0107, Juraj Boljkovac i Mary Burma, postigli su\nposebnu nagradu, \u010dast po\u010dasnog delegata na devetoj kon\nvenciji u Philadelphiji, na taj na\u010din, \u0161to su u jubilarnoj kam\npanji postigli broj od 750 to\u010dkica ili vi\u0161e. Posebnu \u010dast po\n\u010dasnog delegata zaslu\u017eio je i brat John Birek, upravitelj\nHrvatskog Radio Sata u Clevelandu, ogla\u0161ivanjem posebne\nkampanje clevelandskih odsjeka, u kojoj su isti upisali pre\nko 100 novih \u010dlanova u redove Zajednice sa $100,000 \u017eivot\nne osigurnine. Ovih pet po\u010dasnih delegata imati \u0107emo \u010dast\npozdraviti na konvenciji idu\u0107eg rujna.\nPrema va\u0161em zaklju\u010dku od pro\u0161loga rujna, mi sada pro\nvadjamo kampanju u po\u010dast 40-godi\u0161njice opstanka na\u0161eg\nPomlatka. I u ovoj kampanji imamo posebne nagrade, pre\nma kojima \u0107e na\u0161i mladji mo\u0107i postignuti pravo dolaska i\nsudjelovanja na \u010detvrtoj konvenciji Pomlatka, koja \u0107e se\nodr\u017eavati na 2., 3. i 4. srpnja ove godine u Gary, Indiana.\nSvi znakovi do sada pokazuju, da \u0107e na \u010detvrtoj konvenciji\nPomlatka biti zastupano \u010dlanstvo na\u0161ih gnijezda iz raznih\npredjela Amerike' i Kanade i da \u0107e nam kampanja u po\u010dast\nPomlatka, koja traje samo pet mjeseci, biti jedna od naj\nuspje\u0161nijih, koliko se ti\u010de upisane svote nove \u017eivotne osigur\nnine. To \u0107emo postignuti zato, jer imamo u Odjeljenju Po\nmlatka nove, veoma privla\u010dive certifikate osiguranja po no\nvoj tako zvanoj CSO (Commissioners Standard Ordinary)\nljestvici. Mi \u0107emo ovu najmoderniju ljestvicu podnesti de\nvetoj konvenciji na odobrenje i za novo \u010dlanstvo u odraslim\nredovima i ve\u0107 smo opunomo\u0107ili na\u0161eg aktuara, da priredi\npotrebne tablicc uplata po toj novoj ljestvici.\nPripreme za konvenciju\nU suglasju na\u0161ih pravila, glavni predsjednik i glavni\ntajnik objaviti \u0107e slu\u017ebeni poziv u mjesecu travnju za sa\nstanak devete konvencije u rujnu mjesecu u Philadelphiji,\nPennsylvania. Izvr\u0161ni Odbor \u0107e sastaviti listu odsjeka, koji\nsami za sebe biraju jednog ili vi\u0161e delegata, kao i listu od\nsjeka, koji zajedni\u010dki biraju jednog delegata. Odsjeci \u0107e u\nmjesecu svibnju obaviti nominacije kandidata, a u mjesecu\nlipnju izbore delegata.\nPro\u0161la konvencija odr\u017eavala se je na obalama Tihog\nOceana, a ova \u0107e se odr\u017eavati na obalama Atlantskog Oce\nana, u Gradu Bratske Ljubavi City of Brotherly Love\nu kolijevci Ustava Sjedinjenih Dr\u017eava. Koliko god je bio\ninteres medju na\u0161im \u010dlanstvom velik, da vide Sun\u010danu Cali\nforniju za vrijeme osme konvencije, toliko opa\u017eamo ve\u0107 sa\nda medju \u010dlanstvom interes, da posjete ovaj znameniti hi\nstorijski grad Amerike. Na\u0161i odsjeci u Philadelphiji i su\nsjednom Camdenu, New Jersey, izabrali su poseban odbor\nza do\u010dek delegata devete konvencije. Nedavno sam na pro\nlazu za New York po slu\u017ebenom poslu sastao se sa odborom\nza do\u010dek delegata i proveo s njima par sati vrlo ugodnog\nrazgovora, kojom smo prilikom izmijenili mi\u0161ljenja, kako i\n\u0161to ovaj posebni odbor sve sprema, da priredi dostojan do\n\u010dek i \u0161to ugodniji boravak za delegate i goste devete kon\nvencije. Za vrijeme ovog zasjedanja dati \u0107u vam podrobno\nizvje\u0161\u0107e o mojem razgovoru sa odborom, a i mi \u0107emo se\nsami trebati dogovoriti o stanovitim stvarima, koje su Va\u017e\nne za uspjeh same konvencije. O tome \u0107u re\u0107i vi\u0161e, kad ovo\ndodje na dnevni red.\nMedju \u010dlanstvom Zajednice\nU drugoj polovici pro\u0161le godine odr\u017eavane su mnoge\nzna\u010dajne proslave opstanka 60-godi\u0161njice Hrvatske Bratske\nZajednice u raznim predjelima Amerike. Odazvao sam se\nna mnoge pozive i pozdravio \u010dlanstvo u ime Glavnog Od\nbora, \u010dasnika i \u010dlanstva Zajednice. Svuda sam nai\u0161ao na\nnajsrda\u010dniji prijem i bio sam posve zadovoljan sa povolj\nnim raspolo\u017eenjem velike ve\u0107ine na\u0161eg \u010dlanstva prema na\nma na upravi Zajednice. To je najbolji znak, da smo mi do\nsada odr\u017eali na\u0161u rije\u010d zadatu delegatima osme konvencije,\nda \u0107emo upotrebiti sve na\u0161e sile, da u zajedni\u010dkim redovi\nma prevladava prava zajedni\u010darska sloga i jedinstvo, \u0161to je\nnaj\u010dvr\u0161\u0107i uslov izgradnje bolje i sretnije budu\u0107nosti na\u0161e\nustanove i \u010dlanstva u njoj.

The facts and figures given\nabove are not guesses. They were Obtained from \"official records, and they\nillustrate better perhaps than anything else could, the remarkable interest\nthat is being taken in this country by people who are anxious to better\ntheir condition. The figures show (that the dormant period in the West\nIs past, and that with a remarkable influx of new settlers, from the United\nStates, Europe and Eastern Canada\nyet are only guessed at, has awakened.\nPeople now realize as never before that Western Canada is well adapted\nto settlement (that it' can raise immense crops, and that its climate is not\nthat of the Arctic circle. The prevailing Impression of this huge territory\nof fertile land, was, only a few years ago,, that it was a wilderness which\nwould always remain sparsely settled on account of Its rigorous climate, and\nIts'.remoteness. The crop- of 1901told a. different, story, however, and a\ni&lffltiy stream of emigration from the United States commenced to pour in\", in\neight months this year close on 30,000 strong, earnest American settlers, who\nwill do much to further develop e wonderful riches o the soil oindustrcoun- f this\n- itf TfriTlftWP.iTlu\nfound a congenial home.' Nature has apparently marked the West for exalted\ndestinies, and her people, and the new blood infused by the larger influx of\nAmericans, have awakened the country to the vast possibilities it contains for\nmen who are willing to work. Thousands of new settlers are every month\npouring into Manitoba, Alberta, Assiniboia and Saskatchewan, and. the region\nthat stretches west from the Red River valley to the Rocky Mountains, and\naway to the north, will in time be the home of millions. .\" . -\nThe railroad activity illustrates in a striking way the era of Intense\nactivity upon which Western Canada is entering. The Canadian Northern\nwhen its present building plans are completed in about five years, will fur-\nnish the Dominion with a new trans-continental service which will be of\ngreat benefit to the wheat country, and a big factor in its rapid, development.\nThe work of construction is being pushed forward rapidly, and the company\nnow has a continuous line from Port Arthur, Ont., on Lake Superior, to-\nErwood, Saskatchewan, 810 miles. It has constructed altogether, 1,309 miles\nand the line will open up the fertile Saskatchewan Valley, between Prince\nAlbert and Edmonton, running north of and almost parallel to the Canadian\nPacific through the entire breadth of Saskatchewan and Northern' Alberta.\nThe Canadian Pacific railway has large extension plans under consideration.\nThe building of branch lines to accommodate new farming communities is\nbeing carried forward without cessation. Railroads have made Western\nCanada. The real growth of the country dates from the completion of the\nCanadian Pacific railway company's main line, between Port Arthur and.\nWinnipeg in 1882. The undertaking was a stupendous one, but how sue-\nceasful It was may be judged from the immense territory now covered by\nthe company. The C. P. R. with lines already built to Prince Albert in Sa--\nekatchewan and Edmonton in Northern Alberta is throwing out a new l'ne\nfrom Yorkton, in Eastern Saskatchewan,which will be extended to Prince\nAlbert, and, probably in to Edmonton. Another line will run north from\nMoosomin on the main line and the Pipestone branch will be extended\nnorthwest to Reglna. The new lines open up a fertile district where the\nclimate is comparatively mild and. where everything seems to favor, settlers.\n' ' The federal and local governments are sparing no efforts to pour popula-\ntion into the vast unsettled districts of Western Canada. They have been\naided freely by' the co-operation of the railways and by big land companies,,\nsome of the largest of which latter were formed in the United States. The.\nDominion immigration service is now in operation in many of the American\nstates, and in ail the countries of Western Europe. Matter advertising the\nresources t Canada has been distributed broadcast in Great Britain, and the\nresults are shown in the steady stream of English immigrants into this coun-\ntry. Four years ago very few Americans entered Western Canada, but in\n1901 about 18,000 came in, and as a rule bought land, which is being worked\nthis year. The ifact that there are 150,000,000 acres of good land still open\nto settlement' In the West, outside of Manitoba, has no doubt induced\nmany Americans to leave the JJnlted States. There are other reasons, how-\never, which are tersely told by\"J. Obed Smith, the Dominion immigration com-\nmissioner. . .',\nIn an Interview, after furnishing the figures given above, he Said :\nare not so much surprised as people Imagine at the large influx of Ameri-\ncans this year. Our agents In the the United States are abler to, size ^ up\nthe situation pretty well every year, and I could tell from the reports fur-\nnished me every month that between thirty-five and forty, thousand would\nseek land in Western- Canada this year. We 'have an actual record of - 20,000\nAmericans having, travelled by train into this country since January 1, 1902.\nThese figures do not tell anything of the thousands who have crossed the\nInternational boundary in waggons. Hundreds have come in in this way at\npoints on the boundary line, and It has been impossible to keep track of ihem.\nIn the eight months ending August 31, of 1902. 52,860 settlers had been record-^'\ned. In May alone 10,562 settlers came in. During the months of September,\nOctober, November and December we expect to record between 15,000\"-and\n20,000 settlers. Our records for eight months show an increase of 87 per cent,\nover the same period in 1901. The records, it must be understood, do not in-\nclude tourists, capitalists or men connected with big land companies.\nIt Is a noticeable fact that of the American settlers who are entering\nCanada now fully 85 per cent, are men. Most of them are family men, and\nyou can readily understand how great the influx will be next spring, when\nthey bring their families in.\nAugust is only a fair month tor settlers to come in, but'the- returns\nfrom the principal states that are pouring in land-seekers, for, that month\nwill give some idea of the movement from.,the other side: Minnesota, 589\nIowa, 382, North Dakota, 337 Nebraska, 153 South Dakota, 143 'Illinois, 119\nMontana, 198 Wisconsin, 91 Kansas, 80.

He is a\nlittle north of that part of the country that, ai\nthe bonanza wheat belt of the continent, lias\nwon the name of the \"bread basket of the Brit\nish empire.\" Moreover with his wonderful\nachievements with wheat, he himself counsels\nfarmers to devote themselves to diversified agri\nculture, lie does not believe it wise for the\nordinary farmer to raise wheat exclusively. He\nTecognlzes the disadvantage of carrying all the\neggs to market in one basket. Farming, accord\ning to his agricultural creed, is most profitable\nwhen livestock of all kinds, dairying and poultry\nare added to diversified field crops.\nDiversified farming is the general practice of\nthat great stretch of country that lies along the\nOtx -\nBy WALTER NOBLE BURNS.\nLLOYDMINSTER, SASK. Wee Donald's\nhome-coming was like the triumph cf a Roman\nconqueror returning from a victorious campaign.\nThe great Clydesdale stallion had won the\nchampionship of the United States and Canada\nit the Chicago Livestock Exposition, the great\nest show of its kind held on the continent. The\nnews had been flashed back by wire. The\nBoard of trade came together in a special meet\ning. The victory of the horse was turned into a\ncivic event A message of congratulation was\nwired to L. Weaver, his owner. Speeches were\nmade. Everybody shook bands with everybody\nelse.\nWhen finally Wee Donald jtepped from his\nprivate car in the old home town, the winter\nsunlight glistened on his sleek brown bide, he\nwas led through cheering crowds that lined\nLloydminster's main street. Horse and owner\nwere toasted at a public banquet. That's what\nan international victory for its home-grown farm\nanimals means to the Canadian farming country.\nVictory of Horse Civic Triumph.\nEvery citieen of Lloydminster and every\nfarmer in the rich region round about the town\ntook a personal pride in the triumph of the giant\nClydesdale. The animal's perfection, in their .\nminds, was not due so much to his breeding a'nd\nthe care of his owner as to the Canadian climate\nand soil that instills into the pasture grass, the\nclover and alfalfa hay and the oat crops those\nnourishing chemical elements that go to the\nmaking of bone and sinew. 1\nCanada was represented at the Chicago show\nby the pick of its herds and at the Grain and\nHay Show, held in connection with it, by the\nbest products of its soil. In both shows, it met\ncompetition from the best that the United States\nhas tc offer in livestock and grain, and carried\noff generous share of the prizes. Many blue\nribbons were brought back across the inter\nnational boundary in cattle, horses, sheep, hogs\nand grain. ,\nWin Two Years in Succession.\nJohi. W. Lucas of Cayley, Alta., won the\nchampion sweepstakes for oats for the second\nyear in succession. This made it easier for\nCanada to bear the loss of the wheat champion\nship which went to George Kraft of Bozeman,\nMontana. But though Canada was defeated in\nwheat, it was not disgraced. J. C. Mitchell of\nDabinda, who in the two preceding years had\nwon the International honors, was runner op\nnd the decision of the judges between the\nwheat of Mr. Kraft and that of Mr. Mitchell\nwas admittedly a finely-drawn one. There was\ntome solace for the Canadians, however, in the\nfact that, Mr. Kraft's wheat was grown from\nseeti obtained from the famous wheat wizard,\nSeager Wheeler of Rosthern, Sask.\nIt may be said in passing that the wheat\nchampionship of the North American continent\nbas been won by Canada for ten years, hand\nrunning. Eight of these championships, which\nare generally held as the championship of the\nworld, were won by Saskatchewan and one each\nby Manitoba and Alberta. This Is the highest\ntribute that possibly could be paid to the won\nderful soil and climate of Western Canada and\nespecially of that portion of the Dominion that\nlies in the rich agricultural belt along the trans\ncontinental lines of the Canadian National\nRailways.\nCanada'a String of Championships.\nThe international wheat contests began In\n1911 when Seager' Wheeler won $1,000 in gold\nOxford\nFiocic\nGovernment\nExhibit\noffered by Sir Thomas Shaughnessy fcr the best\nbushel of hard spring wheat at the New York\nLand Show. The following year the prize went\nto John Holmes of Raymond, Alta. In 1918 it\nwas won by Paul Garlach of Allen, Sask.\nSeager Wheeler won it again in 1914, 1015 and\n3916.- Samuel Larcombe of Birtle, Man., won\nit in 1917. Seager Wheeler came back into his\nown in 1918. Mitchell of Dahinda captured\nthe honor in 1919 and 1920.\nPeace River country, so far north as to be\nalmost in the region of the midnight sun the\nsun shines there eighteen hours a day in sum\nmer produced wheat that won the first prize in\ncompetition against the continent at the Cen\ntennial Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876. The\nsamo region carried off the international honors\nat the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. Only for\nthe last ten years, however, has Western Canada\nbeen in continuous competition for the cham\npionship and during that decade, one of its\nthree provinces has always held it, wresting it\nfrom time to time from each other but niver\nallowing it to pass from Western Canada.\nThis record is the more remarkable when it\nis considered that fifty years ago the suggestion\nthat wheat could be grown successfully in a land\nso far north as the Western Canadian prairies\nwas met on all sides with profound scepticism.\nNew-Wheat Invades Jack Frost'a Domain.\nSeager Wheeler is famous the world over for\nhis work in originating new and perfecting old\nvarieties of wheat He had much to do in mak\ning Marquis the staple variety of Canada and\none of the most popular varieties in the United\nStates. Kraft's championship wheat was Mar\nquis. Wheeler originated Kitchener wheat and\nhis latest variety is Red Bobs. Red Bobs ripens\nfrom six to ten days earlier than Marquis. By\nreason of its early ripening quality, it escapes\nrust and early frosts. By the time rust makes\nits appearance in Canada and the first frosts\ncome, Red Bobs is in shock and ready for the\nthresher. Seager Wheeler believes that this\nwheat will push the frontiers of the wheat belt\nat least one hundred miles farther north and\nbring into cultivation millions of acres that now\nlie idle within the domain of the frost king.\nSeager Wheeler, who is to wheat what Luther\nBurbcnk is to flowers, has for twenty yean or\nmore worked his wizardy on a farm of only ICO\nacres near Rosthern in Saskatchewan. He could\nhave grown immensely wealthy with his expert\nknowledge of wheat growing if lie had cared to\nfarm on a large scale. But with bis minute and\ncareful method, he has found his quarter-section\nall that is necessary for his scientific purposes.\nEven on this small area be does well in a\nfinancial way and sells seed wheat for prices\nthat have reached as high as $30 a bushel. This\nis a record price. Five world championships an\nalso a record. He also holds the world's per\nacre lecord with 82 bushels to the acre.

It is what may be\ncalled lightly timbered prairie. It is undulating\nand well watered and dotted with coppices of\npoplar and other small trees, easily grubbed out\nif necessary and, if allowed to remain, furnish\ning fine shelter for stock and wind-breaks for\ngrain.\nSettlers Swarm to Fertile Prairies.\nIt is in this fertile belt that the heaviest\nimmigration in recent years has occurred. Most\nof the settlers have been men that have built\ntheir prosperity from small means. It is a\nregion of small farmers who began farming\nunder the tradition of the value of diversified\nagriculture. In this respect it differs from the\nold country of the pioneer wheat barons to the\nsouthward. With land still selling ct from $20\nto $30 on acre, it holds out the greatest oppor\ntunity left on the continent for the poor man to\nestablish himself on a prosperous farm home.\nEvery farmer owns cattle, sheep, horses and\nhogs in addition to cultivating his fields. Under\nan educational campaign carried on by the gov\nernment for years, the value of purebred live\nstock has been inculcated. This tendency to\npure blood has brought all herds and flocks to a\nhigh standard and many of the animals that have\ncarried off international honors at the Chicago ,\nshow have come from this region.\nDairying Rich Source of Profit.\nDairying has become in recent years a large\nindustry. With government financial uid, cream- y\neries have been erected in many towns. Supply- t\ning fanners with a fine local market for their ';\ndairy products, these creameries have been prao- r\ntical sermons on the value of dairying and have i\nhad a strong influence in building up dairy\nherds. In view of the already flourishing con\ndition of dairying, it is safe to predict that this\nregion will in time become one of the great 1\ndairying areas of Canada.\nProduction of beef cattle, sheep and swine is\nalso a prosperous industry. There are more\ncattle and sheep owned by small farmers in the\nregion than in the old days of the big herds and\nthe open range. Farmers in addition find bee\nkeeping and poultry raising profitable side lines.\nAnyone who visits this country and notes its\nrich soil, salubrious climate, well-bred livestock,\nflourishing crops and wide-awake farmer popu\nlation understands at once why it is that year\nafter year, Western Canada scores so many\nvictories in livestock and soil crops in inter\nnational competition against the best produced\non the North American continent.", "batch": "nmu_emerson_ver01", "title_normal": "albuquerque morning journal.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84031081/1922-02-12/ed-1/seq-15.json", "place": ["New Mexico--Bernalillo--Albuquerque"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 13, "county": ["New York"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83030431/1919-12-30/ed-1/seq-13/", "subject": ["New York (N.Y.)--Newspapers.", "New York (State)--New York County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01234953", "New York (State)--New York.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204333", "New York County (N.Y.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["New York"], "date": "19191230", "title": "The sun.

BRYAN, EDITOR AND PROPRIETOR\nm\nVOL. 11, NO. 38\nLincoln, Nebraska, September 29, 1911\nWhole Number 558\nReciprocity Defeated Some of the Causes\nThe overthrow of the liberal government in\nCanada on the reciprocity issue ends the hope\nof the treaty at this time and probably for years.\nThe natural result of the rejection by Canada\nof the overtures made by the United States will\nbe an increase in the tariff in Canada and a dis\ninclination on the part of the United States to\ntake up the subject of reciprocity again soon.\nIt is, considering all that has occurred, unfortu\nnate for two reasons that the subject was\nbrought forward:\n. In the first place it has given protectionists\nof Canada a' chance to appeal to any anti\nAmerican prejudice that exists there and it\nmuBt be admitted that there is such prejudice. It\nMs greater in quantity and more intense than was\nsupposed, has been studiously fanned for parti\nsan purposes until it has developed into a flame\nwhich it will require time to extinguish.\nUnless there IS a real and active feeling\nagainst the people of the United States it is\ndifficult to understand how the people of Canada\ncould have attached as much importance as\nthey did to Speaker Clark's declaration In favor\nof annexation. He said, in suporting the reci\nprocity measure: \"I am in favor of the reci\nprocity treaty because I hope to see the day\nwhen the American flag will float over every\nsquare foot of the British possessions clear to\nthe north pole.\"\nThis was a very Jndiscreet utterance for one\noccupy iirgTToslttoTrTJf\" authority and was at'\nonce condemned by the friends of reciprocity\nin Canada, and it wa3 kept before the people of\nthe dominion.\nA few American papers were unwise enough\nto advocate annexation some may have done\nso with the hope of defeating reciprocity, arid\nall such editorials were reproduced.\nPresident Taft's speeches were construed as\nreflecting upon Canadian attachment to Great\nBritain. The cartoons represented the presi\ndent as trying to force the American flag down\n.the throats of the Canadians. The cartoons of\nthe president were anything but respectful and\nthe language\" employed in denouncing him was\nworse than the cartoons.\nIn this issue will bo found an attack,\nbased on the affidavit of \"one of the most promi\nnent citizens of Montreal\" (name not given.)\nThis appeared In the Ottawa Journal, published\nat the capital, and was reproduced by the con\nservative papers throughout the country.\nIn this issue will also be found a poetic ap\npeal published by conservative papers.\nThe protected manufacturers used the same\ncoercion which has been so successfully em\nployed in the United States.\nThe St. John Telegram, the morning of tho\nelection, published the following:\nWARNING TO ALIj VOTERS!\n\"With tho idea of Intimidating votors In their\nemploy, mombcrs of conservative business houses\nIn this city yesterday circulated personally among\ntheir men tho following Infamous circular, sup\nplied from Tory headquarters In Toronto and\nprinted In black typo:\n\"This Firm Is Opposed to Reciprocity\nor any mcasuro that would Injure\nBritish Connection or tho Industries\nand Farming Interests of Canada.\"\n-Men of St. John, this sort of thing should bo\nresented at tho polls.\nEvery man's vote Is his own sacred right and\nproperty. Bo men! Voto your own way! Do not\nbo intimidated lfi exercising tho sacred right of\nmanhood suffrage.\nThe second reason for regretting that tho\nreciprocity agreement was brought forward\n(now that it has failed) is that it turned atten\ntion away from the real reason for tariff reduc\ntion and laid emphasis upon the idea that a\ntariff tax hurts tho FOREIGNER instead of tho\nconsumer at home.\nIn the discussion on both sides of tho lino\nthe question seemed to be \"which gets the most\nbenefit from the reductions made by tho other?\"\nThe insurgents opposed tho treaty on the ground\nthat we were giving Canada more than wo were\ngetting at least that the faTraers were, and\nthe Canadians opposed it on theTground that\nthey wero getting tho worst of tho trade. Even\nthe fact that tho United States ratified tho\nagreement was urged as proof that Canada\nwould lose moro than she gained.\n(See argument published in the St. John\nGlobe on election day, reproduced on another\npage.)\nWhenever a reciprocity agreement Is pro\nposed the balancing of benefits is necessarily\nthe paramount question. The democrats favored\nthe Taft-Laurier agreement' BECAUSE IT\nMADE A BEGINNING AT TARIFF REDUC\nTION. Now that it has been rejected it is the part of\nwisdom to proceed with tariff reduction FOR\nTHE BENEFIT OF OUR OWN PEOPLE with\nout waiting for the aid or consent of any other\nnation.\nProtectionists in this country will use Cana\nda's action as an excuse for oposing reductions\nbut democrats will not, out of spite, permit con\ntinued extortion by the tariff barons of this\ncountry merely because the tariff barons of\nCanada are to bo permitted to continue their\nimpositions on our northern neighbors.\nft\nCONTENTS\nRECIPROCITY DEFEATED\nCHAMP CLARK'S COMMENT ON CANADA\nELECTION\nSTRANGE, INDEED\nWHAT TRUST WOULD BE ABSOLVED\nUNDER THE SUPREME COURT DECISION\n\"AFTER A TIME\"\nORGANIZING DEMOCRATIC PRECINCT\nCLUBS\nJUDICIAL TYRANNY IN OHIO\n\"I HAVE DONE WITH COMPROMISE,\"\nSAYS FRANK P.

HoBtcr aald that h&\nhad been sent hero at tho Instance of President\nTaft\n'THE INSTRUCTIONS RECEIVED FROM\nWILLIAM R. HEARST\n\"Ills instructions for tho trip, however, had been\nreceived from William Randolph Hearst, In whoso\nemploy he had been for the past ten years. Hearst,\nwho is now in Europe, had cabled Taft that if tho\npresident wished it, Hearst would Bend his best\nman, namely Hostcr, to Canada to make a cam\npaign in favor of reciprocity. Hostcr stated that\nTaft mentioned this to him at tho time, and this\nwas before he had been notified by his employers\nto proceed to Canada. Hostcr said that ho had\nwired Mr. Carvello, (who represents Hearst In hla\nabsence) to tho effect that ho preferred to remain\nat Bovorly, whero President Taft has a summer\nhome. A copy of tho telegram which came back to\nhim from Carvello was given to President Taft, and\nin discussing the matter with Hostor, Taft told\nhim not to bo a 'damn fool,' that ho would bo\npaid for his work, always providing It was satis\nfactory. Hostor added, 'evidently It Is.'\nNOT MUCH REASON TO RE PROUD\n\"That Hostcr, tho chief Hearst plenipotentiary\nnow In Canada scraping up, raking up or digging\nup whole reams of pro-Laurler and pro-reciprocity\nmaterial for the Boston American and other cam-\nfialgn sheets designed for Canadian consumption,\ns not very proud of his composition is shown by\nthe following statements made to the aforesaid\ndeponent:\n'Hostcr said that since his arrival In Montreal\nfrom Now York ho had received letters daily tell\ning him to give every argument In favor of reci\nprocity. Ho had sent in all such 'dope' dally. 1\nam told to deal out this stuff and I am doing It,\nand they say my work Is satisfactory.'\nTHE CONSPIRACY DID NOT ALL LEAK\nOUT THEN\n\"All of the conspiracy did not leak out. Hostor\nexpressed his chagrin in not being allowed to\nproceed with President Taft on his long tour which\nbegan on September 15. Being a close friend of\nTaft's, and also Hearst's chief associate, ho was\nsurprised to find his plans spoiled, particularly\nwhen tho president had asked him to accompany\nhim on tho tour. But because certain matters\nWould come up before September 21st which would\nrequire his prcsenco In Montreal, he was compelled\nto abandon that trip.\n\"Hostor refused to state what these matters were\nexcept that Hearst had personal knowledge of\nthem.\n\"Hero in the boldest outline, is the story of a\nplot against Canadian independence, which for\nconsummate Impudence has no parallel in history.\nHearst has been freely denounced and righteously\nexecrated of late for his unblushing campaign for\nannexation, toward which goal reciprocity Is a\nlong step.

The\nunfortunate condition of affairs in United\nStates packing houses disclosed a couple\nof years age had a most injurious effect\non the beef trade of United States' meat\nmen. but It worked wonders for Canadian\ntrad*.\nFully one-half of the entire area of Can\nada is covered with forests, and already\nthe annual value of the lumber business is\nin excess ot $30,000,000, and It la climbing\noadian Forest\nin leaps and bounds. Every tree that to\nof value growl in this wonderful country.\nThere are white and red pine, the elm,\nbeech, ash, maple, walnut, birch, cedar\nand tamarack.\nUntil within a very few years ago the\nbulk of the business of Canada was con\nfined to Great Britain and the United\nStates, but now the countries of Europe\nare gradually being included, and a large\npart of the old world are looking to Can\nada for furs, foodstuffs and lumber.\nCanada has steadily helped along It*\nhomo industries by a protective system,\nwhich naturally was directed principally\nagainst the United States, and had Its\norigin in a spirit of retaliation against\nUncle Sam's tariff regulations. Particu\nlarly has the protective system been in\nvoked to the sugar and cotton industries.\nProtection has been a success in Can\nada, and, freed of competition by the tar\niff wall. Canadian manufacturers to the\nnumber of 3?iT,40fl have been making rich\nprofits off thu $358, 836,817 they have in\nvested in manufactories.\nMerchant Shipping.\nIt Is a fact not generally understood, but\nCanada is coming to the fore as ona of the\ngreatest shipping nation*. Already only\nthree countries do a greater merchant\nshipping business. Some JMJOO ships are\non the regular books of the Dominion, and\nonly Great Britain, the United States and\nFrance surpass her. Canada leads Ger\nmany, Norway, Italy and other maritime\npowers.\nIn fisheries Canada is abundantly\nblessed. There are not enough people in\nthe country to eat the endless supply that\nis constantly being caught. Canadian fish\nare sent all over the world, and the profit\nof the business is great.\nNot the least factor In the wonderful\nadvance of the last ten years has been\nthe attention which has been given to\ntransportation. In this particular Can\nada is much favored by nature. The St.\nLawrence, with Its lakes, at once puts\nCanada In communication with the most\ncommercial part of the United States and\nwith the open sea. The navigation of this\ngreat water system has been greatly as\nsisted by numerous and extensive canals,\nof which the Rldeau, Cornwall and the\nWelland are the most Important.\nIn one year 30,000 vessels pus through\nCanadian canals, and the number Is ever\non the Increase.\nGrowth of Railroads.\nRamifying tka water system is a re\nmarkable series of railroads, of which\nthe famous Grand Trunk line Is the most\nnoied. Thib is 2,906 miles In length, and\ngives unbroken connection mainly through\nCanadian territory between Detroit and\nPortland, Me. The completion of the\nCanadian Pacific gave communication be\ntween Vancouver, the western end of\nCanada and Montreal, its eastern ter\nminus.\nThe country through which the Cana\ndian Pacific passes is being wonderfully\ndeveloped, for in this case, differing from\nthe system in the United States, the rail\nroad company, instead of '.ooking only for\nits own selfish profits, is doing what it can\nto develop the country for the good of\nCanada. The tide at immigration Is carry\ning into the territory traversed by the\nCanadian Pacific thousands on thousands\nof homeseekers, and they are good stock.\nCanada's government is economical, for\nthe burden of maintaining an army is\nescaped entirely by the fact that Great\nBritain has the responsibility of guarding\nits peace and protecting its interests.\nThe rivalry between the T'nited States\nand this coming new factor In the world's\nbusiness is destined to be espeoially keen\nfrom the fact that the staples of each na\ntion commercially are the same. Both are\ngreat wheat, beef and cotton countries,\nand experts who have investigated the\nCanadian mines say that eventually the\ncoal business of the Dominion will sur\npass that of the United States.\nCities in Transition.\nThe bigger cities like Montreal.

But\nthese two English-speaking nations, in\nthe great institutions of their life'have\nbeen moulded and inspired by what\nmay be called the Anglo-Saxon im\npulse. It is often more Celtic than\nSaxon, and in these Southern States\nrepresented by this Scottish Society,\nthe Anglo-Celtic type has been pre\nserved purer and freer from taint,\neither in blood or in life; than can be\nfound outside of Canada elsewhere in\nall the American Hemisphere.\nThese\" two countries, the United\nStates and Canada, even in their his\ntories have more in common ttha\nunites that differences that divide.\nHere in this very State that boasts\nthe Mecklenburg Declaration and\nKing's Mountain; here in Fayetteville\nwhere you have \"Liberty Point,\" with\nits memorial of a first stand made for\nIndependence by Scottish Patriots and\nPresbyterians \"June 4, 1775\" even\nhere, and in face of all declarations\nand of the records and reminders of\nthe Revolution, I make bold to say-\nthat the historv of the United States\nand Canada, in the things most orig\nInal and most significant, is one his\ntory.\nThe Supreme I-.es.son.\nI Dut it to you: What us the one\nsupreme lesson taught in the history\nof the United States It is not revo\nlution.

If\nmoving aoout among you, inougn l\nfind traces of the Gaelic speech only\nhere and there, I have not had 'ir to\nsearch among the impulses and senti\nments of your lives to find confirma\ntion of the old lines\n\"One in name and one in fame\nAre the sea-divided Gael.\"\nMen may sayr that here in Noi.h\nCarolina the Scottish Gael were di\nvided in theh politics and in their pa\ntriotism. Some of them at Liberty\nPoint in 1775 stood with the Whigs\nand demanded the rights of self-government:\nand in 1776 others of them\nmarched out with the Tories to fight\nfor the Kins.

Ami rictuis, as\na rule, care very little for foreign poli\nties, and they are rarely curious to know\nwhat is gc.ing on in other countries, even\nif there is only Hit- separation of an\nimaginary line and a Mring of custom\nhouses. Of course the people along the\nborder have mutual intercourse that im\npels them to get acquainted, but by far\nthe greater number of Americans know\nlittle or nothing about their northern\nneighbors. The Canadians, on the other\nhand, display a hearty Interest in Ameri\ncan affairs, but they have been repelled\nby the cold indifference of the Yankees.\n\"The 20th century is Canada's,\"' say the\nCanadians. They believe, and with some\nshow of reason, that the great develop\nment that took place in the United States\nIn the latter half of the lftth century will\nhe repeated in their own country in the\nimmediate future. They are prosperous,\nthey are \"growing,\" they are progressive\nIn thought and energetic in action. They\nare developing a distinct national feeling\nand proudly refer to Canada as a \"na\ntion.\" They are not, on the whole, satis\nfied with their estate as a dependency\nupon the British crown, but with practi\ncal unanimity they prefer that rei'ation to\npossible absorption into the United States.\nThey are anything but English\u2014are most\nCanadians\u2014but they have seized with a\nfirm grip upon that most admirable of\nEnglish political traits, the disposition to\npay more attention to substance than to\nform. Nominally, Canada is an appanage\nof the British empire. Certainly it would\ntight for the integrity of the empire. But\nactually, in the ordinary course of affairs,\nCanada is as independent and free as any\nnation on the face of the earth.\nCuriously enough, they think Americans\nhave only the form, and liot the substance,\nof political freedom. But that notion may\nbe the product of ignorance on the Cana\ndian side of the truth concerning their\nneighbors of the .south.\nCanada is bigger than the United States.\nThat is to say, the Dominion of Canada,\nexclusive of Hudson bay, the Gulf of St.\nI-awrence and all tidal waters, has a total\narea of 3.729,665 square miles: while conti\nnental United States, including Alaska,\nhas only 3,616,484 square mile, a balance in\nfavor of Our Lady of the Snows of n::,1Sl\nsquare miles. But over 2,fOO,OCO square\nmiles of the Canadian area is in the\nfrozen and undeveloped north, much of it\nabove the Arctic circle. About 5,000,000\nsquare miles of the American area, in\nAlaska, is of the same character.\nThere are not nearly as many people in\nCanada as there are In the United States.\nAccording to the estimates of the Cana\ndian census of 1911 the population of the\nDominion is 7,358,000. The population of\ncontinental Unted States including Alaska\nIn 1910 was 92,092,230. Two of the states\nof the American union. New York and\nPennsylvania, each has more population\nthan all Canada. During the last decade\nthe percentage of increase in Canada was\n37, as against 20.9 for the entire United\nStates, 21.6 for Pennsylvania and 25.4 for\nNew York state. So. after all, Canada is\nnot doing so badly in the matter of in\ncrease.\nMuch of the increase on the Canadian\nside comes from immigration from the\nUnited States. For a century and a\nquarter the American republic was the\ngreat haven of refuge and land of prom\nise for the man about to move from one\ncountry to another. It still is receiving\nthe greatest tide of immigration known\nIn the history of mankind. But the great\nchange came when, a half dozen years\nago, Americans born and bred, decided to\nemigrate. They went to Canada at first\nby the hundreds, then by the thousands,\nand now they are crossing the border into\nwestern Canada by the hundreds of thous.\nands each year.\nSince 1902 more than half a million\nAmerican citizens have emigrated into\nCanada. Two-thirds of them have for\nsworn their allegiance t& the stars and\nstripes and are now British subjects. Not\ncitizens, mind you, but subjects. Subjects\nof an English king, an English George.\nBut, stranger yet, they like it.

How does that\nstute of facts agree with your old-time\nlMHirth-oi'-.July-lic'n-ta.il-twiJ'tiug-bomc-of*\nthe-brave-Uncle-Sam orations?\nIt is often remarked that Knglishmen in\nthe United States maintain their allegi\nance to lie king and their names on the\nhooks of the British consulate for decade?,\nand cades, while Irish and Scotch and\nCanadians become naturalized citizens at\nonce on their arrival in America. It used\nto be hard to understand. We Americans\ndidn't see why the {Englishman should car\nry iiis absurd patriotism so far. And the\nICnelishmaii, in his stolid way, had noth\ning but contempt for the Scot and the oth\ners who so quickly changed the king's\nprotection for the privilege of voting in\nelection., in a place where the vote might\nnot be counted, after all. We ed to\nthink the lOnglishman stupid, but now\u2014\nhow does it feel to see a hundred thousand\nnative born Americans becoming subjects\nof George V. eacli year? The shoe is on\nthe other foot, and we are becoming, in a\nsmall way, an emigrating people.\nOn the othsr hand, the United Stales\nnow receives from Canada an annual im\nmigration of about 55,000. For nearly a\nhundred years Canada sent us every year\na great number of her young men who\nsought the wider opportunities offered by\nthe rapidly developing republic. Thesa\nyoung men are still coining but not in such\nnumbers. A great number of the Canadi\nans now coining to the United States are\nmill operatives and other laborers. The\nAmericans going into Canada, however,\nare nearly all farmers who are attracted\nby the cheap virgin land of the north\nwest. It is said on good authority that the\nliS.OCO American immigrants to Canada\nlast year took with them an average of\n$1,000 each\u2014a total of ?1CG,000.000.\nEven if this is cut in half, for the sake\nof conservatism, the American immi\ngrants, numbering 125,000. last year took\ninto Canada J62.500.000 while only $20,000\n000 was brought into the United States\nin 1910 by more than a million immigrants\nreceived from all countries. Our emigranta\ntake from us at least $500 each, our immi\ngrants bring to us an average of $20 each.\nCertainly Canada lias the advantage here.\nOf course, this tremendous tide or\nAmerican blood will make western Can\nada American in its social characteristics.\nSome men on this side of the line have\nprofessed astonishment that Canada would\ncontinue to encourage the American set\ntlers in view of this certain result. The\nanswer is to be found in the fact that\nCanada is already American in social\ncharacteristics. Even the French prov\nince of Quebec is more American than it is\neither French or English. There are local\ndifferences of course. South Carolina and\nOntario. Louisiana and Quebec, Maine and\nNova Scotia. Nebraska and Manitoba,\nOregon and British Columbia\u2014they are all\ndifferent., but they are not different in the\nsense that New York differs from York,\nor New Orleans from Orleans. Canada is\nnew world in spirit as well as in geog\nraphy. The Canadians are entitled to re\ncover damages from us because we have\npre-empted the adjective \"American.\"'\nTiie Canadians are just like the people\nsouth of their border line in the essential\ndemocracy of their social structure. They\nstill use two languages, but then the\nFrench never did forget their mother\ntongue easily\u2014there is New Orleans as our\nobject lesson. They differ in religion as\nwe do, but they are much more puritanical\nthan any Europeans, just as we are.\nThe Canadians do business in the Ameri\ncan, not the British, fashion. They ride\nin railroad trains like ours, use the tele\nphone as we do. are tremendously alive to\nthe importance of doing something to\nboost their country\u2014in short the whole\nspirit of the country is the same as ours\nand \\itterly different from that of Eng\nland. They sometimes affect to be more\nhonest than we are, but there are graft\nscandals, trust wars, railroad rates dis\nputes and labor troubles over the line in\nthe dominion as well as In the republic.\nSome of these troublesome things they ap\npear to handle to better advantage than\nwe do, but that may be due in part to the\nfact that the Canadian population is small\ner and the percentage of successes may\nseem to be greater than it really is.\nWithout saying which is better, for each\nhas manifest advantages over the other, it\nremains a fact that in the form of govern-:\nment and in all sorts of political activities,1\nthe United States and Canada are entirely\ndifferent. Now that American relations\nwith Canada have become a question of\nmajor importance in our domestic politics,\nevery American citizen ought to know\nsomething about how the government\nacross the border is conducted.\ning the body so that the head hangs\ndown, or take an ordinary straight\nback chair, turn it over so that the\nback forms an angle with the floor and\nplace the person on the back of the\nchair, with the head hanging down.\nThis position with the head hanging\ndown favors the flow of the blood back\nto the brain.

Early in the eighties,\ne'when the Canadian Pacific was completed\nI fto the prairies of the west, there was a\nr pronounced movement of population from\ni 'the old provinces to Manitoba and the ter\nritories, but it soon fell off and both the\n'XKJW country and the old country gained\nIn population very slowly during the next\n:: twenty years.\nl\\- | A Great Change.\n^v Now, all this is changed, Americans\n?,v,ire moving into Canadaparticularly\n,~,i. western Canadaby the tens of thou\ni aands, and such Canadians as the eastern\nprovinces can spare are pouring in to\nfr'.'avail themselves of the grand opportunity\nST*\"\"lor free or cheap homes. At the same\nIk'J\ntime, American capital is flowing like an\n*' irrigating stream into every portion of\n'''' the dominion, from Cape Breton to Van-\nfK couver's island. Simultaneously, Canadian\n&'- capitalists have become more alert and\nif- daring than formerly And are taking a\nk large part in the openiflg up of the coun-\n' try. This new capital has gone Into iron\n&..' and steel mills, as at Sydney, B. C , and\nI . at the Soo (where the Clergue syndicate\nt'has spent $25,000,000 of American money),\n&\"' into pulp and paper mills in the St. Law\nC lence valley and at the Soo, into scores of\nIfi' Xactori'es of agricultural implements and\nt\"\" utensils, into woolen mills, as Ste. Hya-\n\"y cinthe into nickel and iron mines into\n' *' forests ar.d lumber mills into the great\nV-' chartered banks of Canada into new rail\nf - ways and old, and into the fat lands of\n$' the far-flung and richly fertile prairies of\n&' the Canadian west. It is estimated that\n?'' within the last two years over 25,000,000\nI,, acres of land have been purchased by\n' Americans in the Canadian west. How\n$L much this means is strikingly brought out\n{ when it is recollected that, according to\n!? \" some conservative estimates, the extent\n&- cf the best arable land in western Canada\n!' is 75,000,000 acres. And to this purchased\nH*' and \"homesteaded\" land have flocked in\ny|. the last four years more than 100,000\n\" $- Americans. Into the same western Can-\nf'- ada have poured in the same period about\n?/- 100,000 Europeans and some numerous\nf''. thousands of eastern Canadians.\n|v The Sudden Awakening.\n! There has been much written in ex-\ni.v- planation of this sudden awakening of\nli,, Canada and particularly of this large\nm~[ movement of American population into\nIt* western Canada. Some of it has been\nIp! beside the mark, but the explanation Is\nfg,' simple. In the last five years the popula-\nm\\ tlon of the United States has been in\n^icreasing at the rate of 1,500,000 a year,\n4'and wealth has been accumulated and\n*i? consolidated within the republic on a scale\nhitherto never approached in the world's\nhistory. That wealth has turned in all\n%' directionns for investment, and as natural\nn ty 8T*ve\nmuch attention to Canada, so\nIjp'iiiear and so rioh. Also within the last\n*\n?l lfive years there has been, taking place In\nJthe United States one of those great pop-\n'\" ulation movements which have followed\njeach other every few years since the set-\n!!'tlemen of the continent. But this time\nithe moving multitudes have found less\nf,v :good cheap land and fewer virgin oppor-\nBT i tunities than before. As , they have\n'marched into the American northwest,\nlandB have Increased rapidly in value and\nE, i price, and thiB tendency has made the\njj| j search for cheap lands more tense than\np 4 ever. Western CanadaManitoba, Assini\nP\nw boia. Alberta and Saskatchewanhad rich\njland and cheap land.

The im\nmense crop of that year, about 60,000,000\nbushels of \"wheat from considerably less\nthan 3,000,000 acres attracted the atten\ntion of the world. Then, for the first time\nCanadian wheat began to cut a figure in\nthe markets of the world. The past year,\ndoming on with an even larger crop on an\nacreage not much larger, further directed\nattention to western Canada. It was plain\nto the most careless that a country that\ncould raise two such crops of splendid\nharfc wheat was not just south of the north.\npole or mostly winter. The crop of 1901\ngave a tremendous spurt to the population\nmovement of 1902, and the immense crop\nof 1902, with its average of more than 25,\nhushels of wheat to the acre, has greatly\nstimulated the Immigration this year. The\nManitoba crops of wheat, oats, barley, flax,\nrye and peas for 1901, 1902 and 1891 are\ngiven below,\nI.\nTHURSDAY EVENING,\nWESTERN! ? CANADA\nline was completed across the continent,\nand its numerous branches have since\npenetrated many different districts of the\nnew country. The Indians never wero\ntroublesome in Canada and the conditions\nunder which civilization has spread over\nthe continent north of the boundary wore\nnot such as to encourage the growth of\nthe lawless element that in years agone\nwas the curse, as well as the fascination,\nof the American west.\nAn Immenuse Country.\nAt first agricultural settlement in west\nern Canada was chieflly confined to the\nwide and fertile Red River valley In Mani\ntoba, which is in no way different from\nthe same valley in the United States. But\nlater it crept out across the prairies and\nplains for more than 400 miles west of\nWinnipeg and as far north as Prince Al\nbert on the Saskatchewan, some 300 miles\nnorth of the boundary. West of this indi\ncated area lies the range country of Can\nada, with great wheat regions again to the\nnorth and west, tho these are as yet\nscarcely touched. The' soils and the cli\nmates vary greatly in this spacious region,\nbut the prevalence of fertile land is amaz\ning. In general the climate is milder in\nthe far northwest near the foot of the\nRotrky mountains than it is south and\neast, tho cold winters and warm summers\nare characteristic of the whole region un\nder, consideration. It is generally ad\nmitted that in the not far distant future\nthis enormous extent of rich laiid, produc\ning from 20 to 30 bushels of wheat,to\nthe acre on the average and 40 and 50\nbushels in cases so numerous as not to be\nexceptional, will be the world's greatest\nwheat producing country. Already Mani\ntoba and the territories produce 68,000,000\nbushels of wheat and Manitoba alone\ngathers more than 100,000,000 bushels of\ngrains.\nn\n***\nSome Big Figures.\nThe total area of Manitoba and the\nNorthwest Territories, including Atha\nbasca, whkfli is as yet practically unin\nhabited, is about 384,000,000 acres, of\nwhich about 71,000,000 acres have been\ndisposed of to the Hudson's Bay com\npany, the Canadian Pacific and other rail\nways and various colonization companies\nAssuming that there are 50,000,000 acres\nunder water or otherwise unsuited for use\nthere remain 260,000,000 acres.

As Chicago is the great city\nof the American west, so Winnipeg is now\nthe great city of the Canadian west. It\nis a far cry from Winnipeg's 50,000 people\nto Chicago's 2,000,000, and Winnipeg will\nprobably never be so large a city as Chi\ncago. But even as Chicago is the center\nand dominant city of the American west,\nso will Winnipeg continue to be in Canada.\nThe entire railway system of western\nCanada radiates from Winnipeg, and it\nnow has such a hold on the routes of com\nmerce that even such a road as the Grand\nTrunk Pacific, - planned for a route con\nsiderably north of Winnipeg, has had to\nchange its plans. The fact that Chicago\n1s.on the great lakes while. Winnipeg is\nfar removed from them, does not greatly\nalter the case. If Port Arthur and Fort\nWilliam, on Lake Superior, were sur\nrounded by a splendid agricultural coun\ntry, as Chicago is, the primacy among the\nwestern cities of Canada might go to\nthem as against Winnipeg, because o t\ntheir location on the lakes and their\nwater power. But after leaving .those\nports, whether on the Canadian Northern\nor the Canadian Pacific, the traveler\npasses for upwards of 300 miles ttiru* a\nregion that can never be a great agricul\ntural country.

Even If\nreciprocity or the abolition of tariff duties\nbetween the United States and Canada\nwere greatly to alter trade channels in\nCanada, Winnipeg would still be the gate\nway city. Its location on Lake Michigan\nheiped Chicago to'win in the great con-\ntest with St. Louis, but Port Arthur and\nFt. William will be Winnipeg's ports, just\nas Havre serves Paris. Winnipeg is now\nand will continue to be the clearing house\nfor the business of western -Canada. The\nproducts of that country will be for\nwaided to market and paid for by the cap\nital and management concentrated there.\nThe great business men of the Canadian\nwest, its Hills and Fields and Francises,\nwill reside at Winnipeg. There will be\nthe great, wholesale houses, and there, too,\nwill be centered all the great manufactur\ning interests that western Canada may\ndemand.

As 1 shall\npresently point out, it is not a treaty\neither in form.or substance, and the\npresident, in the absence of authority\nfrom congress, has no more power to\nenter into even a tentative agreement,\nrespecting the tariff with foreign na\ntions, than he has to make a regulation\nof interstate commerce.

Under this clause if we,\nin an independent act, were to admit\nCanadian wheat and cattle free, the\nwheat and cattle of South America, or\nof Europe, would come in free.\nDifficulties In Way.\nThe only way in which we can es\ncape the operation of this clause is to\nmake the concessions we are willing\nto extend to any particular country de\npendent upon what we declare to he\nequivalent concessions from the coun\ntry with which we are dealing. Bven\nthen the nations of Burope, of South\nAmerica! and the Orient, are exceed\ningly reluctant to admit our interpre\ntation of the \"favored nation clause.\"\nI Instance this complication of the sub\nject in order that you may clearly un\nderstand that whatever reduction in\nduties, or whatevct free admissions we\ndesire to establish respecting Canadian\nImports we must establish now and In\nconnection with the paoposed recipro\ncal agreement, unless we are wining to\n\u2022aieaii Owm nnrt\" the\nseme frss- siHaslans to the .entire\ncommcHAM warM. -J ry/\nipviv V^ XT'.'. .' .^7,.''': ,,. ,,\u2022\u2022.\u2022 .\u2022 ,.:. v. v., \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022.... -, ,. ,... .,,, ..\nHISTORY OP NEGOTIATIONS.\nWay Twelve Years.\nI now turn my attention to the im\nmediate proposition, and venture, first,\nan outline of Its history. It is well\nknown that for several years a hope\nhas been cherished among many lead\ners in public affairs, both In the Unit\ned States and Canada, that the two\ncountries would draw closer together\nIn their trade relations, and much ne\ngotiation has at various times taken\nplace upon this subject between the\nrepresentatives of the two govern\nments. These efforts, altho substantial\nly continuous for twelve years or more,\nseemed fruitless but they were never\nwholly abandoned. When President\nTaft was attempting, to apply the max\nimum and minimum provisions to the\ntariff act of 1909 to Canada, he found\nwhat for a time appeared to be in*\nsuperable obstacles in the way of giv\ning to Canada the benefit of our gen\neral tariff, on account of the obvious\nticlng against us,\nLaw Point Strained.\nHe was so unwilling\u2014and very\nproperly unwilling\u2014to apply the pen\nalties of our maximum tariff to Cana\ndian imports that he strained the law\nbeyond its fair construction in order to\navoid a most disastrous result, and he\ndid presently issue his proclamation\nwhich allowed Canadian imports to en\nter our markets under the terms of our\ngeneral tariff.\nOut of this diplomatic intercourse, as\nI understand it, there was re-awakened\na very laudable purpose to readjust\nour relations with the dominion on\nsome better basis, a basis that would\ntake Into account the obvious fact that\nthe conditions of production in Canada\nwere so nearly like the conditions of\nproduction In the United States that\ncommon justice to both countries re\nquired a tariff with Canada that should\nnot apply to the rest of the world, in\nthis spirit, and by the direction of the\npresident, the department of state sent\nrepresentatives to Ottawa to take up\nthe difficult task and for a time the\nnegotiations were carried on in that\ncapital.\nTentative Agreement Reached.\nEarly In the present year the work\nwas removed to Washington, and two\ncabinet ministers of the'dominion, Mr.\nFielding and Mr. Patterson, came to\nWashington to continue the effort In\nitiated at Ottawa. These negotiations\nterminated on the list day of January,\n1911, In an agreement, in so far as the\ncabinet ministers of Canada and the\nsecretary of state of the United States\ncould make an agreement. The sub\nstance of the agreement was that the\ncabinet ministers of Canada would\nurge upon the Canadian parliament the\nadoption of a certain specified free list\ncommon to the two countries: certain\nduties common to the two countries\nupon other commodities and certain\nduties not common to the two coun\ntries upon other articles when Imported\nfrom the United States Into Canada.\nLikewise, the state department of (he\nUnited States agreed that It would\nurge upon congress the adoption of the\ncommon free list a common dutiable\nlist, and certain duties not common to\nthe two countries upon other articles\nwhen imported from Canada into the\nUnited States.\nIt was further understood that the\ncontemplated legislation should not\ntake effect until It has been, or would\nbe, adopted by both countries.\nWEAKNESS IN ARRANGEMENT\nistrative representatives of the two\ngovernments is that they will respec\ntively recommend the proposition to\nthe to the legislative branches of the\ntwo governments, and if the proposi\ntion were adopted \"by the congress of\n(he United States and the parliament\nof Canada, there would then be no ob\nligation whatsoever, so far as the fu\nture conduct of either of the countries\ncould repeal its act and withdraw from\nthe United States every concession\nproposed In the arrangement, and nev\nertheless, our law so passed would re\nntal nln full force and effect and we\nwould be compelled to admit the Im\nports from Canada upon the terms\nstated In the arrangement until con\ngress, thru its ordinary processes, al\nways slof and oftentimes uncertain,\nshould modify our legislation upon the\nsubject.\nMot Sufficiently Bonding,\nIn order that there may he no doubt\nwith regard to this phase of the mat\nter I quote from the letter of (Mr.\nFielding and Mr. Patterson to the sec\nretary of state, under date of Jan.

We look for th continuance of\nthe arrangement, not because either\nparty Is bound to It. but because of our\nconviction that the more liberal trade\npolicy thus to be established will be\nviewed by the people of the United\nStates and Canada as one which will\nstrengthen the friendly relations now\nhappily prevailing, and promote the\ncommercial Interests of both countries.\"\nFREIGHT RATES A FACTOR.\n1\nCansdisn Railroads Could Injurs Am\n\u2022rican Producers.\nThere is another reason which sup\nports the view that a permanent ar- Articles\nrangement with Canada should take\nthe form of a treaty in which each gov\nernment would assume a duty that'\nmay 'become an Important one. A mo\nment's reflection upon the geographical\nrelation of Canada to the United States\nwill recall to your minds the fact that:\nby railway or waterway the producing\nregions of Canada are, or will be, in\ndirect connection with the markets of.\nthis country. In many cases the dls\ntances from one to the other will not\nbe greatly different as compared with\nthe distances from our own producing\nfields into our own markets. The cost\nof transportation is one of the prlnci-\nfor each locality in the United States\nfair relative freight rates. If, how\never, the transportation lines which\nreach from Canada into the United\nStates should give to the producers of\nCanada rates into our markets that\nare unjustly low, as compared with\nrates for equivalent distances In the\nUnited States, It Is manifest that our\n\u2022producers would at once be subjected\nArticles On Which Free Trade is to Be\nEstablishsd.\nWith these Introductory remarks I\nnow beg your attention to the proposi\ntion itself. The schedules attached to\nthe correspondence which passed be\ntween the representatives of the two\ncountries are four in number:\nThe first, being Schedule A, is a re\nciprocal free list that Is to say. It\nspecifies the articles which are to be\nadmitted free of duty when imported\nInto the United States from Canada,\nand when imported Into Canada from\nthe United States. I will not attempt -to\nrecite all the Items but will content\nmyself with a reference to the princi\npal commodities.\n1.

It contains:\n1. Laths shingles sawed boards,\nplaned or finished on one or moro\nsides iron ore, and eual slack.\n2. Aluminum, in plates, sheets, bars,\nand rods.\nExports to Csnads.\nThe fourth schedule, being Schedule\nD. is a list of article* to be admitted\ninto Canada, when exported from the\nUnited States, at certain rat*\u00ab\u00ab of duty\nwhich are not reciprocal. This list\ncomprises:\n1. Cement.\n2. Trees.\n3. Condensed milk unsweetened\nbiscuits fruits In alr-tlght cans or\nother n!r-tlght packages.\n4. Peanuts.\no. Bituminous coal.\nCONSIDERING ITS EFFECTS.\nIm-\nCanada Buys Three-Fourths .of\nports From United States.\nIn considering the purely commercial\nadvantages or disadvantages of the\nproposal of which I have now given\nyou the substance, it Is obvious that\n\u2022we must view It from at least two\nstandpoints:\nFirst, the expansion of our exports\ninto Canada. Induced by the additions\nto her free list of certwin articles, and\nthe reduction of her duties on certain\nother articles.\nSecond, the effect upon our domestic\nproducers and consumers of adding to\nour free list certain commodities, and\nof reducing our duties upon other com\nmodities.\n\u2022I take these viewpoints in the order\nIn which I have stated. The aggregate\nof the Imports Into Canada from all\ncountries In the Inst flscnl year was. In\nround numbers, 1376.000,000. of which\nthere came from the United States. In\nround numbers. $223,000,000. Canada\nbought of us, therefore, under existing\ntariff conditions, practically three\nfifths of all her foreign purchases, and.\nexcluding the element of increased con\nsumption, It Is apparent that whatever\nInroads we make we must make upon\nthe remaining two-fifths of her im\nports.\nWould Cut Revenues Heavily.\nUpon the articles in the proposed re\nciprocal free list which we exported In\nto Canada, for the year ending March\n31. 1919. there were paid In duties.\ntl.47C.12t.lS. These articles were of the\ntotal value of lll,W7,IU that le to\nsay. Canada levied an average equiva\nlent of a 1.7 per cent ad valorem duty\nupon our exports of the articles an\nDraced in inv propoa\u00abu \u2022!\u2022\u00bb, \u00abv\nthe concession as a whole, on these\n.iff\nDominion\u2014Not\nthings can not exceed the percentage\nI have named.\nIt will, however, be interesting. 1 am\nsure to look Into the free list a little\nmote carefully. Tho present average\nCanadian tariff, as against the United\nStates, upon all agricultural products\n(exevpt corn, which is already free)\nincluding live animals poultry vege\ntables and fruits, and including all\ndairy products. e*gs, and seeds. Is\nsubstantially 20 per cent ad valorem,\nThere I* n\u00bb way of ascertaining this\npercentage with absolute precision, but\nmy statement Is practically correct,\nTherefore iti so for as we export in the\nfuture these products into Canada we\nwill receive a very gratifying conces\nsion. and it Is worth while in this con\nnection to remember that, excluding\ncorn, we exported these productions In\nto Canada during the year ending\nMarch 31. 11\u00bb 10. to tho aggregate valu\u00ab\nof $5.671.19-. We are not greatly In\nterester In this quarter In exports of\nfish, and pass tb-'se Items.\ni^wf *& tiyo^\"*^WfoW&tf\nLumber Not Material. I\nThe lumber of the proposed free list,\nwith tho exception of slave bolts. Is\nnow free and Is therefore not material\nIn our present consideration. Crude\nglycerine ha* a duty of IT'^ per cent\nad valorem, and Is made free. We ex\nported during the year to the value of\n$50.-62r. \u2022Salt has a duty of from .\" to\n7^4 cents per hundred pounds, and we\nexported to the value of $81,995. with\nduties aggregating $19,777.75. Practi\ncally all of the rest of the list Is al\nready free until we come to wood pulp\nand paper. Tho chief exceptions are\na 5 per cent duty on tin plate, of which\nwe exported during the year to the\nvnlue of $19K.12P. a 20 per cent duty\non type casting and typesetting ma\nchines of which we exported in the\nyear to the value of $296,662.\nWood Pulp and Paper.\nUpon wood pulp and paper the pres\nent Canadian duty Is substantially 25\nper cent ad valorem, and we exported\nto the value of $695,939 but Inasmuch\nas we do not get Into Canada free with\nwood pulp and paper until all the Ca\nnadian provinces cease to levy any ex\nport duty or fee. or put any restrictive\nlimitation or prphlbltlon upon tho ex\nport of wood, wood pulp or paper, we\nare not likely to derive any benefit\nfrom this part of the free list for a\nlong time to coma. If ever.\nREDUCTIONS HIT FARMERS.\nIf Pros List is Increased, it Must be on\nFarm Products.\nTho conclusion from this brief review\nIs that If wo Increaso our exports to\nCanada becauxo of the additions to the\nfree list wo must do it Inrsely In airrl\ncultural and horticultural producta.\nKlvcerlne, salt, and typesetting and\ncartlnff machines.\nI now take up Schedule# and T,\nwhich show the articles upon which\nCanada will still levy duties, but which\nnro reduced by the proposed arrange\nment.\nTho total value of our exports Into\nCanada of the articles In the reciprocal\ndutiable list arid the reduced non-re\nciprocal list for tho yon'- mentioned was\n$25,880,354, upon which the nverwee\nduty converted into ad valorem was a I\ntrifle less than 25 per ccnt. The pro\nposal Is to reduce this averaire to\nper cent, which moans a concession of\n4\\ per cent. It must not be forgotten\nwhile we are estimating the value of\nthe concessions to the United States\nthat upon nearly all these articles the\npreferential duty granted by Canada to\nGreat Britain Is lower than the reduced\nduty to us, and upon none of them fs\nIt higher. TTnquestlonnhly, we will ba\naided somewhat In the commercial\nstruggle by these reductions, smnll as\nthey are, but It la not possible to pre\ndict to whnt extent even within the\nlntltudo of an estimate To help you to\na conclusion I venture to surest some\nof the main Items of the.\u00abe schedules.\nScheduls B.\n1.

I need not\n.aln mention the articles la the reci\nrocal. free, and dutiable Ilsta, for they\nAre the same.\nThe value of the Imports Into the\nUnited States from Canada of the arti\ncles covered by the proposed free list\nfor the yflfer ending Jwie \u00bb\u2022, l\u00bbl\u00a7, was\n\u00ab3*.811.6\u00ab0. and the average duty levied\nconverted into aid valorem was IS W\nper cent.\nThe Imports of agricultural' products,\nIncluding those of the orchard and par\nden. grouped as before, aggregated $7,\n981.236. upon which our duties were\n$1.\u00ab\u00ab2.310, or an average of a little leas\nthan 21 per cent.\nWe imported'of timber and lumber\nof all kinds made free by the proposal\nof the value of $18,959,753, upon which\noar duties were $1,328,530, or a little in\nexcess of 7 per cent.\nWe imported crude gypsum, unman\nufactured and ground mica feld-spar,\nand crude asbestos,- of. the value of $1,\n8(1.149, but asbestos la now free, and\nive\nimported of that commodity to the\nvalue of $1,087,098. The other articles\nare not of the first Importance.\nWe imported practically no manufac\ntured iron and steel, and of coke to the\nvalue of $219,529, upon which the duty\nhas been 20 per cent ad valorem.\ntinly Three Industries Affected.\n& jwing the Ash industry, we are now\n,-ht^ to the wood pulp and paper\n\"Of these we Imported to the\nii.6 o/ $5,849,600 upon which we lev\n$ 1 duties in the aggregate of $472,308,\n$ upon an average of a little more\nan 8 per centum.\n/This completes my review of the\n^re. list viewed from our side of the\nCanadian line. The most casual con\nsideration clearly Indicates that the\nonly interests that can possibly be af\nfected by free competition with Canada\nare agriculture, lumber, and paper\nmaking. I believe that the imports of\nagricultural products, lumber, wood\npulp and paper will be increased under\nthe proposed arrangement, and I will\npresently touch upon the result of such\nadded Importations.\nRECIPROCAL DUTIABLE LIST.\nImports Not Likely to B* Materially\nIncreased.\npass now to the reciprocal dutiable\nlist, which, as you will remember, em\nbraces articles upon which duties are\nretained, but somewhat reduced. The\ntotal imports of the articles comprised\nin this list for the year mentioned ag\ngregate only $1,619,675, upon which we\nlevied duties of $444,519, or an average\nof 26.8 per cent. The average reduction\nis 14 per cent, leaving an average\nduty still remaining of 12.3 per cent.\nInasmuch as this list comprises only\nmanufactured goods or articles, and in\nasmuch aa it is well known that Can\ndarcan not compete with us on any-\n1\nling like even terms in their produc\n'.on, unless it be flsh packed in oil, it\n.s not likely that the imports will be\nmaterially Increased. If the reduction\nupon this list has any effect upon our\nmarkets it will be In helping to keep\nprices down in those fields of manu\nfacture in which home competition has\nbeet destroyed, and this is a result\nwhich I am sure will meet the hearty\napproval of all our people.\nAs to Schedule C.\nI come Anally to examine for a mo\nment the last schedule in which we are\ninterested namely. Schedule C, which\ncontains a list of articles upon which\nwe are to reduce our duties, but which\nIs not reciprocal that is to say, Can\nada does not change her duties upon\nthese things. As I have already indi\ncated. it comprises aluminum laths\nshingles sawed boards, or other lum\nber planed or finished on one or mora\nidea and eoal slack. Of these articles\nimported from Canada during the\near ending June 30, 1910, to the value.\n88.901,93$. upon which duties were\n'ted of $968,309, or 16.4 per cent. We\nthese duties by the proposed ar\nrangement upon an average of 6.4,\nleaving the equivalent of a duty upon\nthem of 10 per cent ad valorem.

I have been\natrongly tempted- to leave them with\nyou without a single comment, for\nknow that yon are as capable of deduc\ning the conclusions which-ought to be\ndrawn from them as am but the pro\nposal has been attacked *n a great deal\nof unmerited criticism, and It has been\ndefended by a great deal of unintelli\ngent praise, largely, think, because\nboth Its assailants and defendants have\nriot paused long- enough -to. give the\neobject the cbmpfehenlrtve' study that\nIt well deserve*, and venture, there\nin*, to express my own opinion upon\n\u2022MBS' of Its nest Important phases\nint. lists\u2014 have given Oie, matter\nnethought and second, because I\nHu^ithe\nr%\n.j^B^^ftpyj' ...\n3 ,n\nmmm\nhablt of frankly disclosing to\nir Ttawf ttpoa every\nfc'j\n(IT S\u00bbY\n:\".liA\nqusstion which relatss to their welfare.\nIt Is obvious that of the producers of\nthe United States who are to be put in\nfree, or freer oompetltlon with the pro\nducers of Canada, the farmer- mean\ning every man who usea the soil to gain\na living\u2014and the paper manufacturer\nare the men who may have some ap\nprehension with respect to the effect\nof the arrangement upon their business.\nI take these classes in their inverse or\ndar, and I shall dwell very briefly upon\nthe paper trade.\nBanntsr Favors Free Paper.\nI do not suggest that the general ap\nproval of the arrangement by the news\npapers comes about because this par\nticular plan for reciprocity gives them\nfree paper, but I do suggest that the\nonly warrant for free psper, under the\nrule now acknowledged by our system\nof protection, is the combination be\ntween our paper makers, which has\npractically eliminated competition. I\nam for free paper, not only paper of the\nvalue of 4 cents per pound or lesa, but\nof all paper, and I am -for It because\nthe paper makers of this country have\nabused the privilege which has here*\ntofore been conferred upon them. I am\nnot for it because I believe that the\ncost of production is as low in the\nUnited States as in Canada.\nPaper Trust Deserves Punishment.\nImmediately after the bill thru which\nit was sought to carry the arrangement\ninto effect passed the house and was\nreported to the senate. I introduced a\nresolution calling upon the president\nto furnish the senate with the informa\ntion which had been gathered by the\nboard of tariff experts, which, for near\nly two years has been collecting facts\nrespecting the tariff. The president,\nwith as much promptitude as was pos\nsible, submitted the information, and it\nwas laid before the senate In printed\nform on the very day of our adjourn\nment. The report Is not alone com\nplete, but illuminating upon the sub\nject of pulp wood, wood pulp, and newa\nprint paper. I can not enter Into de\ntail, but It is sufficient to say that the\nboard finds that the average cost of\nproducing news print paper per ton in\nCanada is $28.39. and in the United\nStates is $32.53. If there were free and\neffective competition at home it would\nbe difficult to defend free paper, but\nas conditions are I believe that it is\nnot only defensible, but righteous.\nThe original proposition included a\nreciprocal free paper, but the house\namended the bill so that the leglalation,\nif adopted, does not Involve the free\nadmission of paper into Canada. I dare\nnot take the time to explain the reason\nfor the change, inasmuch as in the\nwest, at least, the effect of the ar\nrangement upon agriculture Is not only\nthe chief subject of controversy but the\nchief subject of Importance, and I\ntherefore turn to the affairs of the\nfarmer as the final phase of my discus\nsion.\nWHEAT AND BARLEY.\nTwo Products of Iowa Which Would\nBe Affected.\nIt is my opinion that if the farmer of\nthe United States is put upon even\nterms with the farmer of Canada, with\nrespect to the things he buys, the pro\nposed arrangement would not Injure\nhim. I go further and declare that I\nhave no doubt whatsoever that the far\nmer of Iowa, if given an even chance\nin his purchases with the farmers of\nCanada, will.find in the arrangement a\nsubstantial advantage. In my judgment\nthere are just two agricultural pro\nducts of Importance raised in. the Unit\ned States which may, during short\nperiods, be reduced In price thru the\nfree exchange with Canada. These are\nwheat and barley, and it has seemed\nto me for a long time that, so far as\nIowa Is concerned, it would be better\nfor every farmer, and for every acre of\nland in the state, if we allowed Canada\nto raise all the wheat that we In Iowa\nhave hitherto been producing. I will\nnot stop to review the question, but I\nbelieve that every student who has ex\nplored the subject, and who has com\nprehended the vital necessity of pre\nserving the strength of our soil with\nout resorting to expensive fertilisers,\nwill agree in what I have said.\nCould Give Wheat Fer Free Flour.\nIf we In Iowa can get free flour thru\nreciprocity we can well afford to al\nlow Canada the advantages which will\naccrue to her in free wheat. I must not\nbe understood as admitting that the\nfree Introduction of wheat or barley\nwill lower the price of these products\nthru any considerable period in the\nUnited States. I believe rather that\nthe removal of the duties will raise the\nCanadian price, for it is an uncontro\nvertible fact that, taking tfte dominion\nover, the prices have been lower there\nupon these things than with us, due In\npart, however, to other causes than the\ntariff.\nCanadian Livestock Highest.\nI need not speak of corn, for of course\nthere is no real competition in Canada\nIn this product, and as I have already\nshown, we export large quantities to\nour northern neighbor.\nWith respect to live stock, I have\ntaken some pains to discover what rel\native prices are. comparing Canada and\nthe United States, and this is the re\nsult: The average value of horses In\nthe United States is $108.19 in Canada,\n$133. Dairy cows in the United States,\n$35.79 In Canada, $43. Other cattle,\nwithout respect to age or grade. In the\nUnited States, $19.41 in Canada, $31.\nSheep in the United States. $4.08 In\nCanada. $6. Hogs In the United States,\n$9.14 in Canada, $11.\nI do not forget that on the plains of\nManitoba,. Saskatchewan and Alberta\nthere may in the future be found young\nlower in value than our own, but\nthere is nothing that Iowa needs more\nthan a source toward which she can\nturn for a supply of cheap feeding cat\ntle, and from such imports our corn\nand other cattle foods will be made\nmore valuable than heretofore.\nBearing in mind what I have already\nsaid, I predict that with nearly every\nthing, except wheat, barley, and possi\nbly hay. our exports of agricultural\nproducts Into Canada will grow more\nrapidly than the Imports of such pro\nducts Into the United States from\nCanada. :|4\nWhere the Farmer Has a Kick.\nI regret that I can not at this time\ngo further into the details of the Infor\nmation which we have, all of which\nleads Inevitably to the conclusions\nhave announced. I hope, however, that\nthe farm\nera of this state, as well as\nother states, will with their accustomed\nIntelligence, survey the subject with\npatriotic care before they denounce alt\nreciprocity In commerce.\nIt will be remembered that I said a\nfew moments ago that if we put tho\nfarmer Into free competition with\nCanada common justice and common\ndecency require that he shall buy In a\nmarket as free as that in which the\nCanadian farmer buys. To me it is a\nshocking perversion of a sacred princi\npie-to \"assert that'the fanner should\nsuffer free competition In everything\nho soils and endurs high protection In\nkur. \u00abali anr say Upat\nI Intend, to uas allthe power and In-.\n7*\nS\nii\nfluenoe I have to give the farmer the\nbenefit of free trade with Canada in the\nchief things that he must buy, at the\nsame time and In the same Instrument\nthat Imposes upon him free trade In the\nthings he produces for sale.\nPRIE LIST TOO SMALL.\nMore Canadian Products Should Come\nto Us Without Duty.\nWe are dealing with Canada upon\nthe hypothesis that there is no mater\nial difference between the cost of pro\nduction there and here, if that be true,\nand I believe it to be substantially true,\nwhat reason is there for not admitting\nthe remainder of Canada's natural pro\nducts free, and what reason is there\nfor not admitting a large part of her\nmanufactured products free? I under\nstand perfectly that in many manufac\ntured products Canada can not now\ncompete with us, but the privilege of\nfree entry from the north, even In man\nufactured products, will tend to curb\nand restrict the power and avarice of\ncombinations and monopolies at home.\nIf the farmer sells his cattle In a free\nmarket, who can gainsay his right to\nbuy his lumber In a free market? The\nproposed arrangement makes rough\nlumber free, but still maintains a bur\ndensome duty upon laths, shingles and\nplaned or finished lumber. I insist that\nthe farmer shall have the privilege of\nbuying ALU of his lumber, rough or\nfinished, free of duty. The farmer will\nsell his wheat in free competition. Why\nshould he not be permitted to buy his\ncoal in the same free competition? Can\nany one tell me why iron ore should\nnot come Into the United States free\nupon exactly the same hypothesis that\nagricultural products come In free?\nWhy\nNet Free Flour?\nadmits\nbuck-\nAgain, this arrangement\nwheat, rye, oats, barley, and\nwheat free, and It proposes a duty of\n50 cents a barrel upon wheat flour and\nrye flour 50 cents per hundred pounds\nupon oatmeal and rolled oats one-half\na cent per pound upon buckwheat flour,\nand 17% per cent ad valorem upon\nother cereal foods that Is to Bay, if the\nprice of these grains Is reduced at all\nit Is for the benefit of the miller and\nnot for the benefit of the people. The\nfarmers of Iowa have a right to buy\ntheir flour, their oatmeal, and all other\nsuch things made out of agricultural\nproducts, free, and it is absurd to put\ngrain on the free list and the manu\nfactured product under duty.\nBut this is not all! Cattle, sheep,\nand hogs are to be admitted without\nduty, but meat of all kinds is to pay\na duty of cents per pound. We\ndo not eat cattle, sheep, and hogs, we\neat meat, which is the manufactured\nproduct of these animals, and if we\nput the farmer into free competition\nupon the raw material, why should we\nbe solicitous about the packer who Is\nalready over-strong and over-greedy?\nThe suggestion that the animal should\ncome from Canada to the packer free,\nand that the meat should come from\nCanada to the people with a duty of 1%\ncents a pound upon It is monstrous, and\nought not to be tolerated for a mo\nment.\nI will not go further Into the recital\nof specific things. sum ft all up In\nsaying that every manufactured pro\nduet which enters into the cost of a\nfarmer's work and living should come\nfree from Canada for his benefit. With\nregard to some things there will be no\nadvantage to him now. but In the days\nto come there will be great protection.\nProtection Helps Farther.\nHeretofore thej farmer has, with ab\nsolute truth, been told that altho tariff\nduties upon agricultural products were\nof no considerable advantage to him\ndirectly, yet the system of protection\nwas of great advantage to him Indi\nrectly In that It increased our manu\nfactures, and thereby furnished him\nwith a market that he otherwise would\nnot have. This argument will not\navail in the future, arid we micht as\nwell admit it now, for when the far\nmer is in free trade with Canada with\nrespect to agricultural products it\nmakes no difference to him whether the\nmen who eat or use the things he pro\nduces live In the United States or in\nCanada, and therefore there is but one\nthing to do, and that is to put the far\nmer of the United States upon the\nsame plane with the farmer of Canada\nwith respect to the things that they\nboth buy. and put him there now. thru\nthe arrangement we propose to make.\nSUGGESTED CHANGES.\nSenator Says We Must Givo to Obtain\nConcessions.\nIt is said, first that If we amend the\nbill the result will be to kill It. because\nIt will necessitate the reopening of ne\ngotiations with Canada, the outcome\nof which is in the very nature of\nthings uncertain. The statement is not\ntrue, for the amendment I have sug\ngested does not Involve the consent of\nCanada. In my opinion it would. If\nadopted, be within the terms of the\n-proposed arrangement, and If It Is not.\nIt Is nevertheless impossible to con\nceive of any opposition on the part of\nCanada to the enlargement of our free\nlist. Mark you. I do not propose to\nask Canada, so far as this amendment\nis concerned, to change in the slightest\ndegree the concession which she Is to\nI grant to us. There is not a man here\nwho does not know that if the bill could\nbe amended In the way have suggest\ned It would Immeasurably Increase .the\nchances of the prompt passage of the\nproposal by the Canadian parliament.\nIf congress refuses to ndopt this\namendment, or any part of It. the\nmeasure itself will be In no wise preju-\nMust Extend Privileges.\nIn order to make clear the applica\ntion of what I am about to say, I re\ncall to your minds the statement with\nwhich I began this discussion. If we\nare to give Canada free entry Into our\nmarkets and are unwilling to give It to\nthe whole world, we must give It In\nconnection with, and as an equivalent\nfor concessions that are at the same\ntime granted by Canada to the United\nStates. It Is not possible to establish\nfree trade in these commodities with\nCanada by an Independent act without\nestablishing free trade at the same\ntime In the same commodities with\nnearly all the commercial countries of\nthe earth, for there are in existence\ntreaties with every prominent nation,\nwhich in terms give to those foreign\nnations the same duties on like ar\nticles that wo give to the most favored\nlatlon. The only way In which we are\nable to confine exceptional concessions\nto a particular country Is to Insist that\nthe \"FVnrored Nation Clause\" in our\ntreaties does not control In cases In\nwhich wo lower a duty or admit with\nout duty for a compensation or equiv\nalent. If, therefor*, we are to do Jus\ntice to those wiio an engaged in agri\nculture, and lllc* pursuits, wo must do\nIt now and In connection with this ar\nrangement, for if tho opportunity\npa\nsees it will not return 7\n''9*$\"\nR,M\u00abYILT\u00abAH)TRAI IOTA,\nhave reason to know, that If congress\ntakes the proposed arrangement upon\nwhich tne representatives of the two\ncountries, have reached a common un\nderstanding. and without further con\ncessions from Canada enlarges our\nconcessions, that these enlargements\nwill not be held to be within the Inter\npretation \"Of the \"Favored Nation\nClause,\" and that in giving to Canada\nfree trade in these respects we will give\nIt to the remainder of the world. If\nthis were true it would not change my\nopinion with regard to the wisdom of\ndoing It, unless, possibly, with regard\nto cotton and woolen cloths and cloth\ning, for I believe that the farmer in\nfree trade with Canada has a better\nright to free trade with all the na\ntions of the world in the articles 1\nhave mentioned, than their domestic\nproducer has to protection: hut I deny\nUtterly the validity of the claim that\nFOR BALE\u2014\nFOR RENT*\nTO KXCHANQI\nWANTED.\nWanted\u2014Work, dusting, and sweep\ning.

Oct. 26.\u2014Canada s \u201cin\nvisible border'\u2014that far-flung, un\ndefended line separating her from\nthe United States\u2014is like a thin\nwire stretched across a road\u2014easy\nto trip over.\nThat is what makes the Canadian\nUnited States joint defense project\na delicate problem in neighborly\nrelations as well as a technical\nmatter of guns, tanks, destroyers,\nplanes and machinery.\nThe psychological difficulty lies in\nthe fact that the United States has\nbeen living alone and liking it for\na long time, while Canada is very\nmuch attached to her family\u2014the\nBritish family of nations.\nMore than one prominent Ameri\ncan in past years has unintention\nally curdled the milk of Canadian\nUnited States relations by suggest\ning. or seeming to suggest, that it\nwas high time Canada cut loose\nfrom the family and eloped with her\nbig, handsome neighbor.\nHow It Looks in Ottawa.\nTherefore, whenever Uncle Sam\nbpcomes particularly interested in\nco-operating with Canada it be\ncomes the task of diplomacy to\navoid creating any suspicion that an\nabduction is intended.\nTo many an American living south\nof the undefended frontier such\nCanadian sensitivness seems odd\nespecially in view of the fact the i\nUnited States has no desire to ab\nsorb Canada.\nBut up here the situation looks\ndifferent because American history\nand customs take on a different j\naspect when viewed from the north. j\nBritain, for instance, always has\nbeen Canada's bulwark against for\neign imperialism. In 1914-18 that !\nmeant German imperialism; that is\nalso what it means now.\nCanadians now have fought against\nGerman troops in two wars, but\nnever against German troops in\nvading Canada. Twice, however\u2014in\nthe War of the Revolution and in\nthe War of 1812\u2014they struggled\nagainst invading American armies,\nand barely missed being over\nwhelmed.\nCanada Proud of Its Fight.\nThat was a long, long time ago, of\ncourse. There has been no war '\nbetween the United States and\nCanada for more than a century.\nBut neither has there been any i\nwar between the United States anil\nBritain in the last 100 years. Yet i\npatriots in the United States point\nwith pride to the terrific fight their\nancestors waged, against heavy odds,\nto win their independence from\nBritain.\nCanadians are just as proud of\nthe blood and tears and hardships\nit. cost their ancestors to remain\nBritish.\nWhile the Revolutionary Colon\nists of 1776-1783 were \u201cstriking off\nthe shackles of foreign rule.\" count- j\nless Loyalists were suffering the\nusual fate of conservatives who op- !\npose a violent and successful pop- j\nular upheaval, many were thrown\ninto concentration camps, many\nwhipped, tarred and feathered,\ndragged through horseponds and\ncarried about the town with \u2018tory'\non their breasts '; tens of thousands\nlost their homes through confisca\ntion, including most of the Loyalist\nproperty holders of New- York; about\n100.000 were driven into exile.\nMany Settled in Canada.\nMany of these exile settled in\nCanada, where the hardships they\nendured while establishing new\nhomes in an inhospitable climate\nincreased their bitterness. As one\nCanadian historian puts it:\n\u201cThe fierce anger with which\nthey had resented the indignities of\nwar gave place to a deep and acrid\nhatred, which pervaded every aspect\nof their lives and constituted one of\nthe strongest influences in molding\nthe outlook of their children.\u201d\nIt was the sons and grandsons of\nthese refugees from revolution who\nwere the backbone of Canadian ,\nresistance to invading American\ntroops in 1812-14. Americans ac\ncustomed to thinking of thp war of\n1812 as a naval war\u2014which it also\nwas\u2014naturally remember the sen\nsational naval engagements which\n\u201e put the United States on the map as\na sea power.\nBut Canadian historians empha- j\nsize the land battles, the desperate\nstruggle which to Canadians was\n\"a fight for liberty, against sub\nmersion in the American Union: a .\ndefensive war against a foreign in- !\nvader.\u201d\nOnly 11,300,000 in Canada.\nNow the memory of old conflicts 1\nwith Britain still is strong enough\nin the United States to cause flare\nups of resentment among patriots\nparticularly suspicious of any treno\ntoward the merging of American and\nBritish destinies. Yet the United\nStates is a Nation of 130.000.000\npeople, strong enough to maintain\nits individuality if it chooses.\nCanada, however, is a nation of\nonly 11.300.000 people, and nearly all\nof them live close to the United ;\nStates border, reading the same\nbooks and magazines, seeing the\nfame movies, listening to the same j\nradio broadcasts, thinking, to a\nlarge extent, the same thoughts, and ,\ninfluenced by the same.New World1\nARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY\u2019S REPRESENTATIVE ARRIVES\u2014Bishop Noel B.

At the same time\nit is governing itself\u2014not governed\nfrom Britain\u2014and is separately at\nwar with Germany by virtue of its\nown decision to wage war.\nCanada Is Also American.\nCanada also is American, in area\nthe largest country on the continent,\nand right now is engaged with the\nUnited States in working out joint\nmeasures for the defense of Ameri- i\nca. in co-ordination with the defense\nof Britain.\nThe efforts of the United States\nto prevent the spread of Europe's\nwar to America thus are geared to\nCanada\u2019s efforts to participate as\nactively as possible in the European\nconflict. At the same time Canada,\nwhich is not at war with Japan, is\nco-ordinating its Pacific coast de- :\nfense with that of the UnitPd States,\nwhich is directly menaced by the\nJapanese-German-Italian alliance.\nAll this makes the United States\nCanadian border look more \u2022'invisi\nble\u201d than ever.\nWar Increases Independence.\nNevertheless, Canadians resent\nany suggestion that, because it is\n\"invisible\" and undefended, the\nborder might as well be wiped out\naltogether. On the other hand, they\nresent the mistaken assumption i\nthat because Canada is British it is\nsubject to decisions of the British\ngovernment.\nParadoxically, Canada is more1\nBritish, more American and more\nindependent because of the war.\nHer loyalty to and admiration for j\nBritain has been intensified by the 1\nheroic British resistance to air at- j\ntacks. Her status as an American\npower has been stressed by the Ca- !\nnada-United States joint defense!\nprogram, and her independence has 1\nbeen emphasized by the fact that\nshe is independently at war with\nGermany\u2014not automatically be\ncause of her membership in the\nBritish Commonwealth.\nAll of which, in the opinion of\nexperienced observers here, adds up\nto this: Closest possible co-operation !\nbetween the United States and\nCanada depends on clearest possible\nrecognition that Canada is intensely\nBritish, profoundly American and\nincurably independent.\n1,800,000 Are Declared\nStarving in Nazi Camps\nBy the Associated Press.\nNEW YORK.

George Davis, president of the company, set his automobile up\non a platform, substituted pulleys on the rear axle shafts for the wheels and\nconnected these pulleys to the factory power shaft. But the belts slipped\nand the auto wheels and tires were replaced. The car then ran a 220-volt\ngenerator 24 hours n day for 12 days, supplying the factory with current for\nlight and power without any curtailment in the plant's output.\nSHEET STEEL PLATE\nHOLDS SPEED PEDAL\nHandy Device When Driving Car\nat Moderate Rate.\nSaw-Tooth Edge Engages Lip, Ratchet-\nFashion, Regardless of Wear on.\n; Lining of Band Wearisome\nTask Is Avoided.\nIn using a car with planetary trans\nmission, it was found wearisome to\nkeep the low-speed pedal down by foot\npressure when driving uphill or trav\neling through sand or mud. The pedal\nwas therefore equipped with a piece\nol U-in. sheet steel, with ears or\nflanges on both sides, by means of\nwhich it was. pivoted on a small pin\nfitted through a hole drilled in the\npedal just below the pad.

The saw\ntooth edge engaged the lip, ratchet\nfashion, regardless of the wear on the\nlining of the band which the low-speed\nPedal tightens around the drum in the\ntransmission.\nTo engage the teeth, the driver\nPushes the pedal forward until the car\n\u00ab on low speed, and then, with on\nupward movement of the knee, he\ncauses the teeth to engage. To release\n\u00bbM pedal, the pressure is applied on\nthe portion of the plate just below the\nPivot, so that the teeth rise and dis\nengage. When driving under ordinary\nconditions, the driver's' foot prevents\nwe teeth from dropping to the level\nX the lip, and if he wishes to travel\n* low speed for a few minutes, he\nPresses the pedal forward in the usual\n*ay; but whenever he finds it necea- I\nwry to travel for a considerable dis\ntance on low speed, the teeth are al\nlowed to fall, thus engaging the lip.--\nPopular Mechanics Magazine.\nAVTOrtOBILE\nMen who wash their own cars wilj\n\u2122d a spray brush handy. ,\n\u2022 \u2666 *\nth Tne wise owner will each year clean\n'.\u00bb\u00ab exhaust system thoroughly.\n* . * - * \u25a0.\nBAir leaks are a common cause of\n\"firing, though they are often over\nlooked.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNo good tire of standard make will\n\".?**\u00ab by any standard rim if proper\nly used.

It is ail benealh the chassis, and it Is\n| certainly not arranged in such a way\nj he can give it any marked attention.\nThe clevises, and other parts of the\npoints of the control rods are not pro\nj vided with any means of lubrication,\nso that there seems to be little or noth\ning that the owner can do to take\ncare of this part of the car.\nYet It is the brake and control-'\n; rods which eventually become the\nj most noisy and rnttlesome parts of\n' the car. The little yoke connec-\nI tions with which the little ends of\ni the rods are held together, become\nj full of grit and are naturally bound\ni to wear.\nThe connections through which the\n; brakes are operated are simple and\nj easy to follow. The pedal or lever\nis pivoted and connected with a set\ni of rods and linkage arranged In such\n! a way as to transmit the motion of\nj the foot or hand in reduced and\n! hence more powerful leverage to the\nj brake mechanism.-\nBrake Adjustment.\nIn adjusting brakes some precau\ntions must be kept in mind. In the\ncase of the foot-brake, which Is gen\n! erally the external or contracting\nj type, the bands bear on the exterior\nof the drums In securing the braking\nI effect. There is generally an adjust\n| ment on the exterior part of the\nbrake itself where the adjustment can\nIbe made without any danger of\nchanging the throw of the linkage.\nThis is very important, because If\nthe throw or centers of the links are\nchanged in their relationship they\nwill be affected by the motion of the\nsprings. .\nPerhaps you have noticed In some\ncars that if you watch the brake\npedal, it will move In or out as the\noar springs are deflected. The rea\nson for this is that the rod which\nconnects the brake linkage with the\nbrake operating units, or, in other\nwords, the last link ln the chain of\nrods Is centered so that the upward\nand downward motion of the chas\nsis centers about such a point In re\nlation to the pivot point of the rod\nthat It becomes relatively longer or\nshorter and consequently moves the\nbrake mechanism.\nThere are a great many manufac\nturers who are not putting equalizers\non their cars and in these makes It is\nvery essential to see that the brakes\nare adjusted uniformly.\nHow to Test Brakes.\nAn easy way to test the brakes Is\nto drive at about ten miles an hour\nwhile some one is watching the car.\nApply the brake slightly and allow\nthe observer to note If one wheel was\nlocked before the other. If so, tight\nen the adjustment on the last wheel.to\nlock and try it again. The test can\nbe made ou any kind of a road where\nthe surface beneath each wheel is the\nsame. A flat piece of asphalt makes\na very good place to bold such a teat.\nI'YTHIANS ELECT OFFICERS\nFOR ENSUING TERM\nAt the semi-annual election Of of\nficers Monday night Evening Star\nlodge. No. 26.

This power is retain\ned in the hands of the common people\nunless voluntarily surrendered. All the\npowers which the federal government\nenjoys are merely such powers as the\nstates have voluntarily surrendered to\nthe government The law does not\npresume that the federal government\nl\u00bbas any inherent power within itself.\nThe constitution of the United States\nsets forth the fundamental principles\nwhich the states have surrendered to\nthe federal government. In the gov\nernment of a state of the Union we find\nthat the legislature has unlimited au\nthority, except where they have volun\ntarily restrained themselves either by\nthe constitution of\nthe state, or by the\nconstitution of the\nUnited States. The\n(institution of a\nBtate is not a grant\nof power from the\npeople to the state,\nbut is a restriction\nlipon the power of\nthe legislature.\nOn the other hand,\nIn the Dominion\nof' Canada we find\nthat the common\npeople do not haye\nany' powers what\nsoever except such\nas have been es\npecially gfahted to\nthem. Thfr common\npeople of Canada\nlook to the British\nparliament at Lon\ndon for the source\nof all their powors.\nThe British parlia\nment enacted a law\nfor the govern\nment of Canada\nknown as the Brit\nish North Ameri\ncan act. This act\nis very broad and\ngives to Canada\npractical home rule. Thus we see that\nthe power has been transferred from\nLondon to Ottawa.\nThe Canadian parliament at Ottawa\nhands down as much power as it\nchooses to the various provinces and\nretains the rest of the power within its\nown hands. It has handed down the\npower of local self government in a\nvery large measure to all of the prov\ninces of Canada by positive enactment\nWe thus find a portion of the power\nwhich has been transformed from Lon\ndon to Owatta to be handed down from\nOttawa to the capitals of the various\nCanadian provinces. As an illustra\ntion, let us discuss the Province of\nManitoba. The Dominion parliament\nat Ottawa transferred to the provin\ncial parliament at Winnipeg all the\npowers which the common people there\nare entitled to enjoy. These powers\nare plenary and intended to give that\nprovince practical home rule. The\nprovince is governed by a provincial\nparliament similar to our state legis\nlature. The provincial parliament In\nturn passes down a little closer to the\ncommon people the rights which they\nenjoy by statute.\nNO CONSTITUTION\nTO RESTRICT PEOPLE\nIn doing this they grant to a large\n\u2022xtent home rule to the (dties, villages,\ntowns and rural municipalities. Thus\n\u2022we find that the charters for citie? and\nall other units of government are given\nthem directly by the provincial parlia\nment. In Canada the people are not\nconfronted by their constitutions. In\nthe United States the state constitu\ntion is for the purpose of checking: the\npeople against their own. acts. The\npower in Canada which restrains the\npeople is the government organization\nhigher up. If the local units of gov\nernment desire broader powers than\nthey enjoy they have to make applica\ntion to the provincial parliament to\nbroaden their powers and scope. This\ncan be done at any time upon applica\ntion..\nIn the United States all process of\ngranting larger powers to the legisla\nture is by the amendment of the con\nstitution, which process will require\nsix years'\"to consummate. We have\nalso had pointed out to us illustration\nof what is done in Canada with refer\nence to taxation and many people are\ndesirous that North Dakota shall adopt\nsome of the Canadian ideas with regard\nto taxation, particularly in the rural\ncommunities. We find that it is im\npossible to adopt some of their admir\nable ideas at oncet on account of our\nconstitution prohibiting the legisla\nture from enacting the necessary laws,\nNO TAX ON LAND\nBY THE PROVINCES\nThere is no doubt but that the com\nmon people of the United States can\nenjoy more and fuller powers\nllirflf\n\u2022H\nbe a live one this winter in the legisla\nture, I proceeded to visit the three\nprairie provinces of Canada to study\nin detail the questions wjiich were\nlikely to become live ones during the\nlegislative session and to find out first\nhand the true state of affairs in Canada.\nThere is one noticable difference in\nthe levying of taxes there as compared\nwith our system here, and that is that\nthe provinces levy no tax on lands. The\nmethod of assessment is somewhat\nsimilar to ours, except that the assess\nment goes no further than the rural\nmunicipalities, or city, in which it is\nmade and. because there Is no tax\nlevied for provincial purposes one rural\nmunicipality does not vie with another\nto keep down its assessed value to es\ncape paying the provincial tax. Neither\nis one city interested in the assessment\nof any other city.\nTRY TO ESCAPE\nTAXES IN U. &\nIt is a custom in North Dakota, as\nwell as in most of the American states,\nfor all taxing units to vie with each\nother to see which one can have the\nlowest assessed value, and we find\ncounties do the same thing. This is\ndone in order to escape, as far as pos\nsible, the paying of the taxes for the\nstate government In Canada no such\ncontest presents itself. Each local sub\ndivision assesses its property according\nto the ijeeds of the community. As a\ngeneral proposition lapds in Canada\nare assessed at full value and in the\nrural municipalities we find that the\nprincipal source of revenue is a land\ntax. I sent about three hundred letters\nto actual farmers who themselves were\nofficials in the rural communities ask\u00ad\nHow Canada Taxes Its People\nBy George E. Wallace, Tax Commissioner, North Dakota\nthan\nthe\npeople of Canada on account of thej\nfact that the power is inherent in the\"\ncommon people, but such powers fan\nnot be enjoyed until the constitutional\ninhibitions are removed which, as have\nbeen pointed out, involve a long period\nof time.\nLast summer, instead of taking my\nusual vacation, and knowing that the\nquestion of Canadian taxation would\ning their opinion as to the exemption of\nfarm improvements from taxation.\nIn response to such inquiries I\nreceived back about one hundred\nletters. The writers of these letters\ncould look at the question from a\ndual angle\u2014first, that of the farm\ner paying his tax, and second, that\nof a municipal official being re\nsponsible for the expenditures of\nthe tax. In every case such farm\ners recommend this system and!\nsome entered into long arguments\nin detail, familiar to all students of\ntaxation, as to why the laws were\nbeneficial.\nThe people of Canada would not con\nsent to the taxation of improvements\nV'vVi\nHere are two threshing scenes on the great plains of Canada. Jhe photo\ngraphs were Ibaned to the Leader by M. Wellsch of Stewart Valley, Saskatchewan,\na reader of the Leader. They were taken last fall In the vicinity of his home. Mr.\nWellsch and his father and brothers farm a big tract of land. The .family came\nfrom Minnesota, where the boys were born, and has been in Canada several years.\nELEVEN\nw-JP,\non farm lands. They consider it eco\nnomically wrong to' tax improvements,\nor anything which is the result of labor.\nThey argued that tb tax farm improve\nments would be to discourage the up\nbuilding of the country and that in\nstead of penalizing the industrious\nfarmer and the industrious home\nsteader, it would be fairer, if any dis\ntinction at all was to be made, to give\nhim a bonus or certain exemption from\ntaxation on account of the improve\nments which he has built and by rea\nson of which the country is allowed to\ndevelop and the building of towns and\ncities to be encouraged.\nARGUE LIVE STOCK\nSHOULD BE EXEMPT\nThey likewise declare with confi\ndence of the truth of their assertions\nthat no live stock of any farmer should\nbe taxed. They argue that they are\ntold by their agricultural colleges to\ndiversify and to raise more stock and\nless grain they pqint out that to tax\nthe means of improving the country\nwould be to follow a principle which is\ncondemned by the agricultural colleges.\nNowhere in Canada did I find the least\nsentiment for the taxing of domestic\nanimals or improvements, but on the\nothefe hand, the farmers were amazed\nthat such property was listed for taxa\ntion in the United States.\nAfter the usual and ordinary taxes\nhave been levied on the lands in\nSaskatchewan, they have provided for\nthe levying of a further tax known as\na surtax. This is a tax on ail agri\ncultural lands of 6 1-4 cents per acre,\nirrespective of the value of the lands.\nThe law provides that all land should\nbear this tax, with certain exceptions.\nWe find the exceptions to be very im\u00ab\nportant to the small land owner, and\nparticularly when such land is occu\u00ab\npied. There is exempt from the surtai\nall tracts of 320 acres each where tin\nsame is occupied either by the ownei\nor the tenant and where one-fourth ol\nthe same is under cultivation.\nThis practically exempts all of th\u00ab\nfarmers of the province who hav\u00ab\ntaken up land under the homestead\nact. A tract of land from 320 to G4C\nacres is exempt whether occupied\n01\nnot, providing one-fourth is under cul\ntivation, and from 640 to 1920 acres ia\nexempt from the surtax when one-hall\nof it is under cultivation.\nThe statute likewise provides that all\nlands exceeding 1920 acres belonging ta\none owner\nU3t\nbear the surtax\nwhether the same\nia under cultivation\nor not and whether\nor not there is a\nfamily residing\nupon the same. Thia\ntax Is intended as a\nblow at the specu\nlators who hold\nlarge tracts of land\nwithout improving\nthe same for the\npurpose of reaping\nthe rise in value,\nwhich is sure to\ncome throughout\nthe entire North\nwest. Upon mak\ning inquiry it waa\nfound that no one\nobjected to the sur\ntax except tha\nspeculator and he\nof course is the man\nwho would be ex\npected to object.\nThe hail insur\nance tax of Sas\nkatchewan is the\none about which we\nhear so much today\nin the state of\nNorth Dakota. Thia\nis a compulsory tax of not to\nexceed 4 cents per acre. The\nlaw provides that all lands shall be\nTaxed for the hail insurance tax unless\nwithdrawn as provided by law. We\nfind that the law is made to favor the\nresident and is aimed at thenon-resi\ndint. Provisions are made by which\nrtsidents may withdraw their lands\nfrom the operation of the hail insur\nance tax law by fencing their grazing\nlands. All unpatented homesteads are\nexempt. In the province are large\ntracts of lands held by speculators.\nUpon inquiry we find that the man\nwho complains against the compul\nsory hail insurance tax law in\nSaskatchewan is the non-resident, be\nctusG no provision is outdo whereby\nhe can withdraw his land from the\noperation of the hail insurance tax.\nThe proceeds from this tax are used in\npaying hail losses.\n\"INCREMENT TAX\"\nUSED IN ALBERTA\nIn passing on to the Province of Al\nberta, we find that there is a tax levied\nthere which perhaps is the only one of\nits kind on the continent It is called\nthe unearned increment tax. Upon a\ncursory investigation it would appear\nthat this was more theory than any\nthing else, but upon studying thoro\nughly the provisions of the law it be\ncomes at once very clear how the Cana\ndians tax the unearned increment of\nlands.\nIt provides tha,t when an application\nt\u00bb made to have the title registered that\nthe officer in charge shall determine\nfrom his records how much the land\ncost the man who is now selling it\nFive per cent of the difference be\ntween the buying and the selling price\nis used as a base for the tax, and the\nlocal rates are applied. This law, like\nthe hail insurance tax law, provides\nfor an exemption of property from its\nprovisions. The most important ex\nemptions from the provisions of the\nunearned increment tax law are that\noccupied lands when at least 10 per\ncent is cultivated up to 640 acres will\nbe exempt and above 640 acres taxe&\non the excess of ?50 per acre.\nThe law does not apply to lands with\nin the incorporated cities or villages\nexcept such land as may be brought\ninto such cities or villages after the\ntaking effect of the law. Upon making\nInvestigation at the provincial treasur\ner's office we find that this tax is not\nremunerative, paying something over\n$37,000 a year. We find that there is\nno one clamoring for a repeal of its\nprovisions. It will be noticed that oc\ncupied lands are favored and that the\n(Continued on page 18)", "batch": "ndhi_kramer_ver01", "title_normal": "nonpartisan leader.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn89074443/1917-02-22/ed-1/seq-11.json", "place": ["Minnesota--Hennepin--Minneapolis", "Minnesota--Ramsey--St. Paul", "North Dakota--Cass--Fargo"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 63, "county": ["New York"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83030431/1919-07-27/ed-1/seq-63/", "subject": ["New York (N.Y.)--Newspapers.", "New York (State)--New York County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01234953", "New York (State)--New York.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204333", "New York County (N.Y.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["New York"], "date": "19190727", "title": "The sun.

Most of us have given our ad\nmiration to Canada for what her gallant\nsons did on the battlefields of Belgium\nand France, for that is the ono of her ef\nforts wo heard most about But while the\nCanadian troops were fighting abroad Ca\nnadians at homo were doing things quite\nas important toward the general success\nof the allied cause growing huge crops,\nmaking munitions, ordering their finan\ncial and economic affairs to suit the Yfats\ntic clianges brought about by tho war and\nmaking of themselves a more united peo\nple, politically and socially, than ever.\nJust what our neighbors to the north\nof us did to work out all this enormous\nand highly successful effort is recounted\nby J. Castcll Hopkins in Canada at War.\nIn its field (of telling what one nation did\nas its wholo war effort) it is the first work\nto be published since hostilities ceased. It\nIs remarkably comprehensive and is writ\nten in a style that is a pleasure to read.\nIn addition to this, Mr. Hopkins writes of\ncontroversial matters, such as differences\nin politics, the attitude of the people of\nQuebec Province toward conscription, and\nthe merits and defects of military \"and\nGovernmental leaders, with a fair minded\nncss seldom met with. In fact, his chap\nter on The French Canadians and the War\n13 a model of presenting a controversial\nquestion that all writers on war. and mil\nitary politics would do well to study.\nMr. Hopkins begins with a chapter de\nvoted to conditions in Canada on- the eve\nof the war, in which he shows that the\npopulation of the Dominion held much tho\nsame opinions as most Americans did at\nthat time, namely: That war was not a\nlikelihood; that if it came it would bo\nshort; that a war in Europe wa3 not much\nof an affair, of North Americans, after alL\nHe holds th opinion that our American\npacifist and materialist ideas had seeped\ninto Canada with small profit to those in\nfected. Later on, he shows that conscrip\ntion had to come to the provinces'' of the\nDominion, os it did to us, out of the very\nreasons of indifference wiiich pacifism and\nmaterialism breed. Nothing better illus\ntrates tho speed with which Canada be\ngan its war effort than the fact that as\nearly as September 22, 1914, forty-nine\ndays after war was declared, the first con\ntingent of Canadian troops sailed down\nthe St. Lawrence to the sea, 32,000 men\nin all, at on initial expenditure of $20,\n000,000. To Canada's purely military efforts and\nncliiovcments Mr. Hopkins devotes six\nchapters. The first of these are\" entitled\nOn the Way to War liaising an Army;\nCanadians in England (devoted to the\ntraining periods) ; Canadians at the Front\n(a chapter for each year from 1915 to\n1917 inclusive) ; and The Year of Victory\n1918. He then gives a chapter to Mu\nnitions of War; another to War Eco\nnomics and Conditions in Canada; War\nGifts and Patriotic Work of the People;\nUnion Government and the War Elec\ntions, and The End Canada, a British\nNation.

Conditions\nin the steel and iron industry werp not of\nthe best in 1914 and practically no shell\nhad been made in Canada up to that time.\nBut within four months after the out\nbreak of the war fifty Canadian manufac\nturers, large and small, were engaged in\nmaking shell for the British Government\nTho Canadian Pacific Railway turned ono\nof its Montreal shops into a munitions\nplant and within a few months .10,000\nmen were at work in it By March,\n1915, there were 200 plants engaged in\nmunitions work, the contracts on hand\namounting to $80,000,000. \"As a matter\nof fac Canada had delivered 250,000\nBhells in England before British factories,\noutside of Government arsenals, had got\nto work there.\"\nOther things than shell were made, for\nby September 30, 1916, the value of ex\nports of manufactured poods of all classes\namounted to $361,000,000 for the year\nending on that date, or about $40,000,000\na month, in comparison with a little over\n$5,000,000 a month before the war. In\nthe last six months of 1918 Canada, made\n55 per cent of the shrapnel needed by the\nBritish.\nEconomically, Canada took extraordi\nnary strides during the war, for at its\nopening it was a debtor nation while at\nits close \"it was lending money and ship\nping more products abroad than were im\nported.\" To the five national war loans\nthe people subscribed a total of $1,690,\n000,000. The total bank deposits in\ncreased by $660,000,000 during the war.\nCanada went through labor troubles, dis\naffection over the increased prices of\ncommodities, granting of tho vote to.\nwomen and clamping the lid down on\nDemon Rum. \"\nMr. Hopkins closes his important and'\nvaluable work with this summary:\n\"The year 1914 4iad seen Canada enter\ntho \"World \"War as one of a number of\ndependent Dominions, or subsidiary coun\ntries in a great British Empire; the year\n199 saw Canada a recognized nation in\na group of nations still called and still\nacting unitedly as the British Empire.\n\"Within tho Empire its Prime Minister\nhad during 1917 and 1918 sat as a mem\nber of an Imperial \"War Cabinet and had\nhelped Great Britain to guide the greater\nevents of the wartime action; its right to\nshare in the negotiations and terms of\npeace vwas freely recognized by British\nleaders asa natural consequence of na\ntional participation in the war. -In form\nits right of separate action and policy\nwas at the Peace Conference admitted; in\neffect it remained one of the British Dele\ngation with all the prestige and influence\nwhich that position involved at a world\ngathering, where Britain was the dominant\npower and British\" policy the prevailing\nforce.\"\nCANADA AT WAR, Bt J.

It is safe to assume that if the causes are the\nsame the results will be the same.\n\"The statement that Mrs. McCarty hit you in the eye,\u201d\nsaid the judge to Mrs. Cahill, \u2018\u2018is merely testimony, but\nthe way your eye looks might be construed as corrobora\ntive evidence because there is no doubt that something\nhit you and from the appearance of Mrs. McCarty I am\nof the opinion that she is capable.\u201d\nThere is a vast difference between testimony and evi\ndence. Testimony may be an unproven statement while\nevidence is a proven matter of fact. Like the after-din\nner speaker, we have attempted to drag you into a sub\nject that may seem dry but which is, in our belief the\nmost important subject that can be considered today\nnamely: What has the future in store for business?\nWill the United States enjoy continued or increased\nprosperity during the war. or will there be a slump- Per\nsonally, we belive the United States is on the eye of a\nperiod of the greatest business success any nation has\never enjoyed.\nBut our opinion is merely testimony unless we can back\nit up with evidence and that is exactly what we propose to\ndo. We propose to lay the facts before you and let you\nbe the judge. \u2022\nSo \u201cyour honor\u201d we say to you: \u2018\u2018We shall lay before\nyou an array of facts that point to a conclusion that can\nnot be denied.\u201d\nThese facts have to do with conditions in Canada. We\nplace them before you because it ia safa to assunv\nwhat has happened in Canada wrill happen in the United\nStates. Why?\nBecause what happened in Canada in 1914 when Great\nBritain declared war upon Germany is happening to us\ntoday.\nTo follow the law of logic that equal effects result from\nequal cause and as the causes are the same it is safe to\nassume that the effects will be the same.\nIn 1914, Canada was asked for men and treasure. Just\nas the United States is being asked for both today, Canada\nresponded as the United States ,s re: ponding today.\nCanada sent 400,000 men to th - from- took them from\ntheir regular jobs and sent them .o war. This means 5\nper cent of the total population of Canada, which is about\n8.000,000.\nCanada loaned Great Britain 200 million and extended\nto her a credit of 250 million more.\nOne city in Canada\u2014a city of less than a half million\npeople\u2014raised three and a half million dollars for the Red\nCross in less than four days time.\nIf the United States, based upon her population, were\nto do the job as Canada has done she would send five mil\nlion men abroad and would extend to her allies in loans\nand credits the vast sum of five billions or more.\nWhat would such a drain on the population and wealth\nof the United States mean? Would it mean business\nbanruptcy or would it mean greater prosperity?\nSome may say we couldn\u2019t stand it and that\u2019s the reason\nwe are going to tell you exactly what has happened and\nis happening in Canada today.\nCanada imported from the United States in 1913, 441\nmillion dollars; in 1916 she imported 500 millions. The\ntotal exports of Canada in 1913 were 474 millions\u2014in\n1916 they had jumped to 1,052 millions.\nCanada's total trade for twelve months ending Septem\nber, 1916, increased over the previous twelve months from\n935 millions to 1.738 millions. 1\nWhen Canada declared war in 1914 the people had in\nsavings banks 400 million dollars\u2014an average deposit of\n$50 for every man. In 1917 deposits had increased to\nnearly a billion\u2014the average deposit being $92.50. In\n1915 Canada added 100 millions to her bank deposits\u2014in\n1916, she added 200 millions.\nJust what does this mean. It means that although\nCanada is at war\u2014that although 5 per cent of her popu\nlation is at the front, that she is buying more\u2014manufac\nturing more\u2014selling more\u2014saving more and spending\nmore money than she ever.\n'jblicity to Canada's war experience as it af\nfects business conditions because we believe, and every\nindication e-oes to show, that the United States is enter- f\ning upon the era of its greatest pros\nThe people of Lee county need only to sit level in the\nboat, conserve their resources, live economically, save the\nwaste, support the government, work the crops to gath- ji\nering time and we sincerely believe you will experience\nthe most wonderful prosperity this section has ever\nknown. ,,\ni\n\u2014\n- !\nComplete Line of Furniture.

Pureed at\nBismarck, the\n22nd Inst\nThe farmer today takes nsore\nchances in his business than\nany other person engaged in\nbusiness, and gets the smallest\nreturns for his labor and his in\nvestment.\n-The agricultural interest of\nthis country is the greatest and\nmost important one. It is the\none most necessary to the ex\nistence of our citizens, hi rue\nought to receive the best care\nof our government. Since 18C6\nthe republican party has been\nin control of the federal govern\nment, and has administered its\naffairs, and one of its basic\nprinciples is the high protec\ntive tariff. The imposition of a\nhigh protective tariff is said to\nbe necessary to give protection\nto our home industries and to\nAmerican laborers, and preserv\ning the American markets for\nthe American people.\nThe farming interests cf the\nUnited States have been told\nthat they are protected by the\nhigh tariff advocated and en\nacted into law by the present\nadministration. This policy has\nbeen criticised severely, that is,\nthe policy of the high protec\ntive tariff, criticised not only\nby the opposition party, but by\nthe very large portion of the\ndominant party in control. The\nfarmer, or agriculturist year af\nter year has been led to believe\nthat this policy was the true\none, and has given his supper\nand adherence to the principle\nof protection upon the theory\nthat the farmer or agriculturist\nwas in a measure protected by\nthis policy. Recently an agree,\nmerit was entered into between\nre a of at a\nthe President of the United\nStates, on behalf of the United\nStates, and certain commission\ners appointed by the Canadian\ngovernment on behalf of Cana\nda,by theterms of which agree\ninent every product of the farm\nin Canada is to be transported\nfree of duty from one country\nto the other, that is, wheat, oats,\nbarley, rye, flax, millet, clover\nseed, speltz, cattle, hogs etc., all\nmeats everything the farmer\nraises in the United States can\nbe sent into Canada without\npaying any tariff or duty or tax\nand Canadian products of the\nsame kind and character can be\nbrought into the United States,\nand put upon the market with\nout paying any tariff, or duty\nor tax. It is the same way with\nmeats, cattle, horses, garden\ntruck, and also certain other\nproducts not herein mentioned.\nThere are other provisions in\nthis agreement. Rough lumber,\nfor instance, sawed, can come\ninto this country free from\nCanada, but not the manufact\nured lumber. It is further\nagreed that each country will\nenact into law this agreement\nso as to make it binding upon\neach nation. It is termed a re\nciprocal agreement, meaning\nthat the concessions made by\none country are compensated\nby the other country in making\nconcessions in the way of per\nmitting their products or man\nufactured articles to go from\none country to the other with\nout permitting the payment of\nany tariff, any tax or duty\nthereon.\nThe tariff laws as they now\nexist, which is termed \"protec\ntion\" applicable to the farmer\nand his products, requires tl\npayment of 25 cents a bushtl\ntariff tax or duty upon every\nbushel of wheat that is brought\ninto the nited States for sale\nor consumption from Canada\nrequires the payment of 30 cents\na bushel on barley, and on oth\ner grains correspondingly. All\nfarming products, all meats,\nlive stock, are subject to duty,\ntariff and tax, before they can\n4,\n-4.\ntc\ncome into the American mark\nets from Caneda for sale or con\nsumption. Th^y may come\nthrough the United States,\nhowever, in what is called a\nbonded condition, that is, goods\nmay be shipped from Canada\nthrough the United States to\nthe seaport for the purposes of\nexportation to a foreign country\nwithout the payment of any\nduty, tariff or tax. This is what\nis called a bonded condition,\nbut has no application to the\nquestion under discussion.\nIf the terms of this agree\nment entered into between\nCanada and the United States\nare enacted into law by both\ncountries, and becomes enforc\ned, it will have the effect of\npractically opening up markets\nof the United States to all agri\ncultural products of the Cana\ndian people, tree of duty, tax or\ntariff. This will materially af\nfeet the agriculturist or farmers\nof Minnesota, North and South\nDakota and Iowa, and perhaps\nWisconsin and Montana. Take\nit as an illustration upon bar\nley. The American brewers, by\nreason of existing laws,- are\nforced to use much of the low\ngrade barley raised in the Unit\ned States for malting purposes,\nbecause of this 30 cents a bush\nel tariff or tax, that they have\nto pay upon better barley for\nmalting purposes rai in\nCanada, if they should buy it\nthere and bring it over to the\nit S at so at\nAmerican farmer has reaped a\nbenefit to this extent on barley,\nthat it has kept out of the\nAmerican markets the* better\nbarley of Canada, and forced\nthe American matters to use a\nl.-trge quantity of low grade\nAmerican barley for malting\npurposes, which if this recipro\nil agreement becomes a law,\ncan now only be sold or used\nfor feeding purposes, in other\nwords, our low grade barleys\nnow used by maltsters will no\nlonger be used by maltbtefs for\nmalting purposes.\nSo it is with wheat. Under\nexisting laws, wheat is taxed in\ntransit from Canada to the\nUnited States for sale or con\nsumption, 25 cents a bushel,\nwhile ordinarily wheat in Cana\nda and the United States ought\nto be the same price, because\nFire\n\"T.\n.-K\n1\n'y^Vl ---j!\n\"iv \"V\n-AU'\neach country exports wheat,\nthat if, after the American peo\nple have taken out of the crop\nwheat raised by them each vear\nthat which will be sufficient to\ncarry them through the year in\nthe way of seed and flour, they\nsell the rest, and the market for\nour surplus wheat is Liverpool,\nEngland. This is always the\nmarket of the surplus wheat of\nthe world, it all goes to Liver.\npool, and whatever the price of\nS'\nI\n'i&k\n^7\nSuccessors to\nEckes & Vanarhan\nMr. J. W.

Vaughan retain\ntheir membership in the firm\nWahpeton Furniture Co.\n\"Your Approval is Our Ambition\"\nwheat is in Liverpool, England,\nit is the price the world over,\nless the cost of transporting it\nto that point.\nTherefore it would seem as\nthough wheat should be the\nsame price in Canada as the\nUnited States, because the sur\nplus of both countries is gener\nally of the same grade, and\nkind, and brings the same price\nin the gteat markets of the\nworld, Liverpool. However,\nThe Fire Insurance Com\npanies have turned over\nto me all of the General\nMerchandise, saved from\nmy store, to sell.\nThis merchandise con\nsists of\nGroceries, Canned\nGoods, Dry Goods,\nUnderwear, Hosiery\nand Furnishings\nThe Gopher Store has\nbeen secured for a limit\ned time and these goods\nwill be put on sale begin\nning Saturday, morning,\nMarch 4, and will be\nsold regardless of cost or\nrvalue.\nI\n\",\ni,*:i.V'VV-\n1\nmm\n*'c''*\u2022*\u2022',\u2022*&>\nthis is not always so. Most of\nthe time American wheat is\nfrom five to seven cents higher\nin the American markets than\nit is in the Canadian markets.\nThis is not because of a better\ngrade of wheat, but it is the re\nsult of the fact that 9 per\ncent of the wheat producing\narea of the United States pro\nduces what is known as soft, or\nwinter wheat, that is, wheat\nsowed in the fall of the year,\n(Continued on page 5)\nW.

At the Inst session of the Canadian parUft\nment, the Canadian tariff law was amended by the addition of\na clause providing that the valuing imports for purposes of\nlevying tariff duties no depreciation of foreign currency\nshould be recognised in excess of 50 per cent.\nCANADIAN INDUSTRIES MENACED BY\nCHEAP FOREIGN GOODS.\nThe following is an illustration of how this law would oper-1\nate:\nUnder the normal rate of exchange the par value of the\nGerman high murk ia 23.8 cents. Vt the current rate >i\nchange the value of the Germai' mark is less than em cent.\nex\nIf German currency were uot depreciated and the normal rate\nof exchange prevailed, a German article valued at 200 marks, |\nimported into Canada, would be in terms of Canadian m a.ey\nvalued at $47.60. Upon this valuation Canada would levy\nUnder present valuations in Germany, a German\nlier tariff.\nmade article valued at 200 marks is worth in Canadian monej\nIt is to prevent the importation of foreign-made\ngoods at such ridiculously low valuations that Canada has\namended her tariff law.\nonly $2.00.\nA \"50-50\" Valuation Plan.\nThe effect of the amendment to the Canadian tariff law is\nto recognize no depreciation of foreign currency in excess\nof 50 per cent in fixing vaulations on imports. That is. a\nGerman made article under present conditions costing 200\nmarks, instead of being valued at the present rate of exchange\n(less than one cent to the>mark) would be valued in the Can\nadian customhouse at the rate of 11.9 cents to the mark, or\nIn other words, the Canadian valuation amendment ;\nto its tariff arbitrarily fixes 11.9 cents (one-half the normal\nvalue) as the lowest value which will be recognized for the\nGerman mark in assessing valuations on German imports.\nAt the time the amendment was made it was thought this\nwould effectually stop the flooding of Canadian markets with\ncheaply made and cheaply valued foreign goods. Canadian\nmanufacturers have discovered however, that the amendment\nis being evaded by German goods being sent into Holland for\nreshipment. There they are repacked, relabeled and ship\nped to Canada as products of the Netherlands, with invoices\nmade out in terms of Dutch currency. Inasmuch as Dutch\ncurrency is practically at par in Canada, the valuation amend\nment to the Canadian tariff does not apply to goods shipped\nfrom Holland and valued in terms of Dutch currency. Under\nthis scheme the process is as follows:\nHow Law is Evaded.\nGermany produces an article which she values at 200 marks\nIn the world of international commerce and finance today that\nmeans a value of less than $2.00. She ships the goods into\nHolland for reshipment. For this privilege she pays the\nsmall tax to Holland of five per cent. The goods are repack\ned and relabeled and then shipped to Canada with the valua\ntion on them expressed in terms of Dutch currency. Had\nshe shipped the goods direet to Canada, the would have been\narbitrarily valued at $23.80, as above stated. In internation\nal exchange the goods are really worth $2.00. Any valua\nturn less than $23.80 (expressed in terms of Dutch currency)\nrepresents the degree to which Grrmany evades the Canadian\nlaw, without in the least affecting her profits on the goods.\nGrievous as this complaint is, Canadian manufacturers have\na greater one against commission men and jobbers of theii\nown .home country. They have ascertained that British\nbrokerage and commission concerns are buying large quanti\nties of German made goods paid for in depreciated German\ncurrency, taking them to England and there repacking and re\n$23 80.\nP!\n,/\nf\nL-s\nA pipe won't burn your V\nlongue if you smoke R A.!\nGet that pipe-party-bee buzzing in your smoke\nsection!

Trade Policy\nBut the country has had no real\ng i lance ln regard to the main prin\niciples which will regulate trade\npolicy in tho comlng years. No\n?vere Indictment of tho government\ncan perhaps be lodged on that score.\nPreaumably the resolutiona of the\nParia Economic Conference, agreed\non in the summer of 1916, still stand,\nI ut the ukimate plans will doubtless\n>e influenced by the proceedings of\n' ? peace oouncil's economic con?\nference, since it is at least possiblc\nthal tbe complete subjection and de\npendence of Germany on the good\n:' the Allies will considerably\nmodify original intentions and\nnecessitiea.\nThe government, however, has im\nmediately to take into account the\ndomestic situation produced by the\nBudden termination of the war, in?\ncluding the official control of trade\nin multifarious dlrcctions, tho level\nof prices often arislng directly from\n.ntrol, the state of interna?\ntional Indebtedness, the interest of\ntrader, manufacturer and consumer\nand the intensifled rivalry of for\neij^n countries to which much over\nI cause they depended largely upon\n: the United States for a market for\ntheir products and for transporta?\ntion facilities, and they have feared,\n! perhaps unnecessarily, that a prefer\n| ence to Canada would invite retalia\nI tion by the United States. Jamaica\nnow supplies something like 17,000,\n; 000 bundles of bananas annually to\ni the United States market, and, nat\nurally, is anxious not to offend its\nrich customer.\nOrdinary commercial troaties at\nbest are of uncertain life and the\nsuggestion of ratification by the\nBritish Parliament has been put\nforward to overcome this objec\njtion and to afford to the British\nWest Indies such assurance of a\npermanent market in Canada, in\nstead of one of indefinite duration,\nas would justify them in incurring\nwhatever risk there may be of an\ntagonizing powerful interests in the\nUnited States. This plan huB as its\nprincipal exponent in Canada T, B.\nMacaulay, of Montreal, president\nof the Sun Life Assurance. Company\nof Canada, and also president of the\nCanadian-West Indian League. Mr.\nMacaulay professea to see almost\ninsuperablo objections to a political\nunion, and has said that \"the idea\nthat a Canadian federal clection\nmight turn on the vote of the Brit?\nish West indies would be equally as\nridiculous as the controlling of West\nIndian affairs by a Canadian major?\nity.\"\nThe political union project, on the\nother hand, has a st.rong advocate in\nthe pcrson of II. J. Crowe, a Cana?\ndian cosmopolite of moans, business\nassociato of Baron Beaverbrook, and\ntho man who had much to do with\nthe negotiations leading up to thc\nfoundation of the Harmsworth en\ntcrprises in Newfoundland. Mr.\nCrowe has spcnl much time in rccent\nyears in lhe West Indies, and has\ndono much to educate the peo?\nple of \"\"anada and those of the West\nIndies to the dcsirability of closer\nrelations for their mutual advan\ntagc. [le makea out a plausible\ncase for political union, urging the\ninclusion of Newfoundland, as well,\nin a Greatcr Canada Confederation.\nHia programme has met with en\ncouragement in tho United King- !\ndom, and also in Canada and in the \\\nWest Indies, and he has been gain- I\ning some newspaper support. He is\ncontinuing his efforts, believing that\nnothingshort ofactual political union \\\ncould provide such permanence for\ncloser trade relations as is necessary\nto attract Canadian, British and for\noign capital and to promote the full\ndevelopment of the colonies.\nUnion Would Make\n(\"anada Self-Sufficient\nAs a Canadian publication has said : i\n\"It i ortainly is a glorious vision.\nCanada already constitutes one-third\nof the arca of the British Empire.

The real\neffect of high price,; upon thc great\nmajority has been masked by the\nriso in wages, but this panacea has\nbrought into existonco wireapread\ncconomic troubles and, although the\nauthoritios are under pressuro from\ntime to time of the extremo school,\nthe opinion is still strongly held that\nfor a nation so dependent as Great\nBritain upon the products of others\nthe full-blooded form of protection\nis unsuitable.\nThe Government\nFaces a Dilvnuna i\nThe real demand of the moment is j\nfor a maximum of freedom to the ,\nfndividual without prejudice to the\ncontroversial mattera involved ln\nany schemo of fiacal reform.

Un\ndoubtedly such a union would grcat\nly augment the commercial, indus?\ntrial and political importance of this\ncountry, and would result in con\nsiderable stimulus being given to the\ndevelopment of both Canada and\nthe West Indies.\"\nHeciprocity With\nThe West Indies\nA movement for local confedera\ntion of all the British West Indies\nand the British territories on the j\nadjacent mainland now is in prog\nress, and appears to have developed !\nmuch greater strength than any pre- |\nvious effort in this direction. Trade j\namong these colonie3 themselves\ndoes not offer any great promise, i\nhowever, and the urgent necessity |\nfor an outlet for their products pro\nvides an impressive argument\nagainst a policy of watchful waiting\nuntil a local federation shall have\nbeen consummatcd.\nFifteen years ago the British\nI West Indies and the British colonies\n' on the mainland benefited by Cana\ndian fiscal policy, and the circum- j\nstancea are frequently referred to I\nas an outstanding example of how\nimperial preferenccs may advanta\ngeously be applied. In 1900 Canada\nwas drawing only 2.4 per cent of its\nimported sugar from the West\nIndies and British Guiana, the re\nmainder coming from continental\nEurope. Germany aione supplied j\nmore than 50 per cent. The maxi- j\nmum preference under the Canadian i\ntariff then came into effect, but it I\nwas insumcient to overcome Ger\nmany's advantage. Germany was J\ndiscriminating against the Dominion\nby imposing the maximum German\ntariff, because of the imperial pref?\nerence extended by this country to\ngoods of British origin. In retalia\ntion, in 1903, Canada imposed a\nsurtax on German goods, and dur?\ning tho next year the British West\nIndies increased their share in the\nCanadian sugar trade from 2.4 per\ncent to 76 per cent, while Germany\nfurnishod less than 4 per cent of\nCanada's importa of sugar.\nIn general it may be said that\nthe West Indian colonies have bene\nfited more than has Canada from the\nreciprocity agreement of 1912. The\n'ollowing figures show that, until the\nfiscal year 191(5-'17, Canada's ex\nporta to the West Indies proper\nshowed no perceptible gain, while\nimports from those colonies were\nlargely increased:\nCanada's exports to Canada's imports\nthe British from the British\nWest Indies.

Thc re?\nport adds:\n\"According to value, the import\ntrade has remained almost station\nary, which indicates, as prices are\nso much higlu-r, that the actual vol\nume of imports has decreased.

The Dominion\ngovernment maintains a trade com\nmissioner at Bridgetown, Barbados,\nwho is agent also for the Bermudas\nand British Guiana. In addition\nCanadian commercial agents are\nstationed at Port of Spain, Trini\ndad, and at Nassau, Bahamas; and\ntheir work has met with some suc\ncess. The customs preference, how\never, on many manufactured com\nmodities has not been aufficient to\noffset the handicap under which the\nCanadian producer is working.\nMuch of the Canadian export trade\nwith the colonies of the Caribbean\nhas been in foodstuffs, such as\nwheat flour, potatoes, fisli, etc.\nThe war has dernonstrated that\ngeographically the colonies in ques?\ntion are tributary to the United\nStates, and, to the chagrin of Cana?\ndian interests, the United States ap?\nparently has regarded the islands\nand mainland colonies as logically\n?conomic dependents of the repub?\nlic.

Uncle\nSam does not care to part with capable\nand experienced agriculturalists, t'p at\nWinnipeg they keep wry accurate records\nrelating to this subject, ami these records\nshow that he has lost over one hundred\nthousand annually during the last three\n.Mars, and that the number is increasing\neach year. Uncle Sam is now giving\nthought to the matter of ways and means\nof keeping his farmers; and, since that\nis so, it may be well to investigate Cana\nda's method of getting them.\nLet us first consider the extent and\nnature of this movement of population,\nthat we may judge i>\\' its present serious\nness and possible future growth.\nDuring the twelve fiscal years between\nApril 1, 1000, and March 81, 1012, a\ntotal of 795,726 Americans, or an average\nof 66,310 per annum. Dave crossed the\nborder and taken up their residence in\nCanada, and of this number 131,340.\n(about one-sixth of tlie total) made the\nchange during 1 he last one of these years,\nand 355,589 (approximately l\"i per cent.\nof the total) during the last three years.\nThis was a larger number of Immigrants\nthan Canada received from any other\ncountry whatsoever, and was over 41 per\ncent, of her total immigration during that\nperiod. Moreover, during at least a part\nof this time she was making' a special\neffort to attract English settlers, and for\nthat purpose was offering them oppor\ntunities that were open to no others; but,.\nin Spite of all, the immigration tables\nshowed an ever-increasing preponderance\nof Americans.\nSome of these are of the city riff-raff,\nof course, and some seek new fields merely\nbecause l they have failed in the old ones;\nbut tin 1 great majority are able and in\ndustrious men \u2014 merchants and mechanics\nas well as farmers \u2014who are a decided\nacquisition to any country. And the move\nment is the more surprising because the\nQnited Slates is neither over populated\nnor over-developed. Yet, Americans are\nflocking to Canada; and this emigration,\nwhile almost negligible, numerically, com\npared with the l 'astle ('nrden immigration,\nis significant because of its character.\nA battery of reapers, in the Bow River Valley, Alberta\nWhat we receive from Europe, for the\nmost part, is the raw material (not al\nways the most promising) for citizenship\nin a land of opportunity, while what we\nare losing is the finished product.\nCanada, especially western Canada, is\nthe newer country in the sense that de\nvelopment upon any comprehensive scale\nhas come much later; and, of course, that\ncounts for a good deal. There is more\nland available for settlement, and there\nTHE SEMI-MONTHLY MAGAZINE SECTION\nELLIOTT FLOWER\nare more opportunities in proportion to\npopulation for industrial development.\nHon 't Overlook t lie latter point ! Ton\nmany people think of agricultural oppor\ntunities only, and there an 1 many others.\nstill, t'oi' (lie development of a country\nupon ii sound basis you must gel the\nfarmer first, The others will then come\nfast enough. It is the farmer who builds\nthe cities, even it' be doesn't live in\nthem, <\u00b0t>i\u2022 l sometimes lie builds them too\nlust; that is, population and business in\ncrease faster* than provision can he made\nin meet their growing needs, Edmqpton\nhas had a part of its population living\nin tents, even during the winter, for sev\neral years, owing to tlie fact that its nu\nmerical growth has heen too rapid for its\nbuilders, and the bousing problem has\nbeen a serious one with other towns and\ncities of western Canada \u2014Calgary, Mcd\nSeine Hat. Vancouver, Etegina, Saskatoon,\nand even Winnipeg. The hotel situation\nis interesting in this connection. You\ncan 't he sure of a room in any town of\nimportance between Winnipeg and Vic\ntoria, unless you engage it ahead by wire\nor mail. It seems impossible to build hotels\nfast enough in these places.\nThese conditions are due lo the rapidity\nwith which western Canada has been and\nis being developed, and this rapid develop\nnient is the result of the jnost intelligent,\nearnest and effective campaign for popu\nhit ion ever undertaken by any country.\nThe campaign is of recent inception, how\never, and the more strenuous, probably,\nbecause of earlier indifference. There has\nbeen land for those who wished to take\nit on Government terms for many years;\nbut il is only of late that any serious effort\nwas made to induce them to take it. Amer\nican immigration vvns so small as to lie\nnegligible up to 1898-9.\nCanada welcomed those who came; but\nshe extended no very cordial invitation\nto them to conn l . Now, she does; and she\nis getting both native ami naturalized\nAmericans. Her success, so far. has been\nthe more noteworthy, because there have\nbeen serious obstacles to overcome, for\ninstance, Canada's climatic reputation.\nIn the old days the Hudson Bay Com\npany, desiring to keep the country for its\nown exploitation, encouraged, or at least\ndid not discourage, the idea that it was a\nland of almost perpetual ice and snow;\nand the very first tiling to be done, with\na view to successful colonization, was to\neradicate that impression. It was no easy\nlask. Indeed, the impression still prevails\nin many minds, although, as a matter of\nfad, in climatic conditions a huge part\nof western Canada compares more than\nfavorably with many of our northern\nslates. The ehinoo\u00df winds temper the w in-\nter, and even where the mercury does try\nto slip out of the bottom of the tube,\nthe blizzards that we experience are iisu\nally lacking.\nFor rapid colonization, however, it is\nnot enough merely to call attention, no\nmatter how vociferously, to natural re\nsources and advantages* That will help;\nbut the natural opportunities must, be\nSupplemented by attractive propositions,\nand therein Canada has been particularly\nHow docs an advertiser lioltl ycnr trade? Ily living value.\nprogressive. She has propositions for all\n\u2014 the man with little and the man with\nmuch. Hiiring the last few years, she has\nmade especial efforts to attract the man\nwith a fair supply of ready cash, the man\nof experience who will accomplish the\nmost with the least help; Init the other\nnot forgotten, she offers everything\nfrom th\" raw land to the ready-made\nfarm, from the natural conditions to irri\ngation, from the small fruit ranch to the\nliig alfalfa and grain farm; and her terms\nvary to meet all reasonable conditions.\nYou may ''homestead 160 acres of\nland (if you are a Canadian or declare\nyour intention to become one), and you\nmay pre-empt additional adjoining land.\nYou may also acquire land by purchase\nup to 64(1 acres. These are primarily Do\nminion government propositions; for the\nl bale a) i, 11. 1.. Iludswa\nPicking prunes in British Columbia\nfree homestead is not granted upon some\nprovincial government lands, although\nthey may be obtained by pre-emption.\nThe homestead cost is only the amount\nof the registration fee; but the home\nsteader must reside upon the land at least\nsix months in every year and cultivate at\nleast fifteen acres for three years before\ntitle passes to him. pre-empted land must\nbe paid for at the rate of one dollar an\nacre, with similar conditions as to resi\ndence and cultivation, and purchased land\ncosts from five dollars to ten dollars an\nacre, according to its location and char\nacter; but the terms are very easy \u2014in\nsome cases no payment, except the regis\ntration and recording fees, is required for\ntwo years.\nThe widest range Of conditions ami\nprices, however, is found iii the railroad\nand land company propositions, especially\nthe former. This is due to the fad that\nprivate capital frequently does more in\nthe way of preparing the land for the\nsettler, and it is therefore possible to get\nfarms and fruit ranches in all stages of\nimprovement. The free homestead is lack\ning here, of course, as is also the require\nmint of intended citizenship; but a crop\npayment plan for some of the land has\nbeen devised that is easier than any other\nmethod of purchase. This calls for an\ninitial cash payment of one tenth the price\nof the land, after which the farm is prac\ntically worked on shares until paid for.\nThe cost of land thus utilized may be only\na few dollars an acre; tut the prices range\nupward, through the various other coloni\nzat ion plans, until the irrigated ami read] -\nmade farm is reached on the one hand,\nand tlie irrigated and improved fruit\nranch on the other.\nCor irrigation, of course, makes a dif\nference in cost, and it is irrigation that\nis developing much of southern Alberta.\nEven in districts where il is not altogether\nnecessary where the rainfall is ordi\nnarily sufficient \u2014 it makes all the differ\nence between probability and certainty, in\naddition to increasing the productiveness\nOf the land; and in some districts it is\nrecognized as a necessity.\nThis was so clearly seen in 1894 that\nthe Dominion government withdrew from\n150 Gifts\nTo Women\nProfit-Sharing Coupons\nWe have a new\nPremium List\njust from the press.\nIt pictures 150 things\nwanted by women, chil\ndren and men.\nAnything shown in it\ncan be paid for by cou\npons from packages of\nMother's Oats.\nAlso by coupons from\nMother's Wheat Hearts\n\u2014the granulated white\nheart of the wheat.\nAny Gift at Once\nSend Coupons Later\nThe book tells a plan by\nwhich any premium can be\nhad at once.

Staaten-Congrc\u00df\nwurde eine Bill eingebracht, die den\nZweck hat, diese Vereinigung zu beschleu\nnigen, und der Eisenda'bnmagnat Eras\nmus Wieman hat muticb die canadischen\nVolksvertreter eingeladen, an einer Ex\ncur sum thcilmnehmen, um sich einmal\ndie Ver. Staaten aus der R\u00fche gr\u00fcnd\nlich besehen.\nEs dr\u00e4ngt sich mm dem unparteiischen\nBeobachter unwillk\u00fcrlich die Frage aus,\nwelcher Nutzen w\u00fcrde f\u00fcr beide Theile\nvon einer Vereinigung *u erwarten sein\nund wie werden beide Nationen der\nFrage gegen\u00fcber Stellung nehmen?\nDa ich jahrelang in Canada gelebt\nhabe und mit den verschiedenen Schich\nten der Bev\u00f6lkerung in Ber\u00fchrung ge*\nkommen bin, mag es mir wohl erlaubt\nsein, hier\u00fcber eine Ansicht zu haben und\ndieselbe \u00f6ffentlich zu \u00e4u\u00dfern, besonders\nda meine fr\u00fcheren Korrespondenzen von\nund \u00fcber Canada im \u00abWahrbeits freund'\neine freundliche Aufnahme gefunden ha\nBen.\nIch m\u00f6chte weniger die commereielle\nSeite der Fraae in's Auge fassen, son\nbetn deren L\u00f6sung einer competenteren\nFeder \u00fcberlassen. Nur so viel will ich\nbemerken, da\u00df man in Canada die Mev\nnunfl vertreten findet, die weit mehr\nentwickelte amerikanische Industrie werde,\nwenn die Schutzzollschranke fallen sollte,\ntrie vielfach noch in de\u00ab Kinderschuhen\nsteckende canadische Industrie ruiniren.\nBei den letzten Wahlen spielte der\nSchutzzoll und Freihandel, oder wie man\nes in Canada nennt \u201eNational Policr/4\nor Unrestricted Reciprocity\" cine\nHauptrolle, und das Land entschied f\u00fcr\ndie \u201eNational PolicyDie Ueberale\nPartei, weiche Freihandel auf ihr Ban\nnet geschrieben, jedoch von einer Anne\nxion nichts wissen wollte, machte dennoch\nkl\u00e4glich Fiasko \u00fcber diesen Punct.\nEine andere Seite der Frage ist die\npolitische und die religi\u00f6se, und es wird\ndie Leser Ihres gesch\u00e4tzten Blattes ge^\nwi\u00df interessiren, dieselbe eingehend be\nhandelt zu sehen.\nCanada hat bei einem Fl\u00e4cheninhalt\nvon 3,500,000 Quadratmcilen nur 5\nMillionen Einwohner, welche ihrer Ab\nstammung nach sich auf franMsche,\nenglische, schottische und irische Canadier\nvertheilen. Die Deutschen und andere\nNationalit\u00e4ten kommen ihrer verh\u00e4lt\nni\u00dfm\u00e4\u00dfig geringen Zahl wegen kaum in\nBetracht. Die eisten Ansiedler waren\nFranzosen, ein fromm gl\u00e4ubiges, gut\nkatholisches Volk. Ein protestantischer\nSchriftsteller, Prof. Samuel E. Daw\nson vom MeBill-College, schreitt: \u201eWir\nm\u00fcssen bedenken, da\u00df es nicht das revo\nlution\u00e4re Frankreich war, welches die\nfranz\u00f6sische Rasse nach Canada ver\npflanzte, sondern das Frankreich Hein\nrich IV., frei, tolerant und ritterlich.\nFrankreich mit dem Lilienbanner, nicht\nFrankreich mit der Tricolore.\" Von\ndiesen Ansiedlern wurden Montreal und\nQuebec gegr\u00fcndet ihr Patriotismus\nund ihre Fr\u00f6mmigkeit leben noch beute\nin diesem Volke fort. Haupts\u00e4chlich ist\nMe Provinz Quebec die Pflanzung dieser\nPioniere der Religion und Civilisation.\nIhre Nachkommen haben sich vielfach\nMit den civilisirt und christlich geworde\n\u00aben Indianern vermischt, und so bilden\ndieselben eine sest abgeschlossene, beson\ndere Nationalit\u00e4t, die sich vielfach auch\nin der Hautfarbe verr\u00e4th. Mann kann\nin der Provinz Quebec Meilen weit\nwandern, ohne auch nur eine einzige\nPerson zu finden, die ein Wort Englisch\nversieht. Ein bedeutender Factor darf\nbei Behandlung dieser Frage nicht \u00fcber\ns.'hcn werden^ es ist dieses die katholische\nGeistlichkeit. Ein protestantischer Ge\nlehrter, der die Geschichte Canada's\nw\u00e4hrend der amerikanischen Revolutions\nPeriode behandelt, sagt von dem Clerus\nund den damals lebenden Ansiedlern:\n,/lhe more they saw of the Yankees,\nthe lees they liked them.\" \u201eJe mehr\nsie von den Yankees sahen, desto weni\nger gefielen sie ihnen.\" Dasselbe l\u00e4\u00dft\nsich noch heute sagen. Die katholischen\nPriester f\u00fcrchten, und wohl nicht mit\nUnrecht, da\u00df ihr Volk durch Vermischung\nmit den Amerikanern nicht nur seine\nNationalit\u00e4t, sondern auch seinen Glau\nben verliert. Darum werden von dieser\nSeite auch die gr\u00f6\u00dften Anstrengungen\ngemacht, um die Canadier in Canada\nzu halten. Es existiren Colonisations\nVereine wie z. B. der von Temis\nearning unter dem Protectorat der\nBisch\u00f6fe, zu dem Zwecke, katholische\nAnsiedelung zu f\u00f6rdern, und zu deren\nUnterst\u00fctzung wird flei\u00dfig eollectirt.\nM\u00e4chtige Vereine, wie z. B. L'Associa\ntion St. Jean Baptifte haben sich die\nAufgabe gestellt, das religi\u00f6se und na\ntionale Bewu\u00dftsein ihrer Stammesge\nnossen zu erhalten und zu kr\u00e4ftigen. Im\nJahre 1884 feierte obengenannter Ver\nein sein 60j\u00e4hrigeS Jubil\u00e4um. Aus\neiner zu diesem Zwecke verfa\u00dften Fest\nfchtift (Le Journal du Dimanche) f\u00fchre\nich folgende Stelle an: \u201eDie Canadier\nwaren die Herolde der Religion auf die\nfem Continente. Sie waren die Pro\nniere der Civilisation in Amerika, und\ndie Spuren ihrer Fu\u00dfstapfcn, der Ar\nbeiten ihrer Forscher, ihrer Soldaten\nund ihrer Mission\u00e4re sind zu finden auf\nunserer ganzen geographischen Karte,\nvom (lap Breton bis Walla Walla..\nSie waren die Vorl\u00e4ufer der constitu\ntionc\u00fcen Ver\u00e4nderungen, welche uns\neine repr\u00e4sentative Regierung gaben und\ndie besiegte Rasse auf gleiche Stufe mit\nden Siegern stellte. Nie hat das eng\u00ab\nlische System den besonderen Bed\u00fcrf\nnissen einer eigenth\u00fcmlichen Situation\nsich besser angepa\u00dft, und es gereicht den\nCanadiern immer zur Chre, da\u00df sie diese\nGem ft ion nicht nur vollst\u00e4ndig zu\nsch\u00e4tzen wu\u00dften, sondern auch redlich\nihren Theil beigetragen haben zur Ver\nvollkommnrmg unsere8 Gemeinwesens\nund zum Ausbau des gl\u00fccklichen Landes,\ndem anzugeh\u00f6ren unser Stolz ist. Ja,\ndie Canadier bilden halb Canada nicht\nnur an Zahl, sondern auch an morali\nscher Kraft, und ihre Treue zu England,\ngepaart mit ihrer Liebe zu Frankreich,\nist eines der merkw\u00fcrdigsten Schauspiele\nin der Weltgeschichte.\"\nNein, der franz\u00f6sische Canadier hat\nkein Bed\u00fcrfni\u00df f\u00fcr eine Annexion er\nliebt seine Religion und seine nationalen\nEigenth\u00fcmlichkeiten zu sehr, als da\u00df er\ndieselben um das Linsenmus einer\nUnion verkaufen w\u00fcrde. Dabei ist er\naber seinem weiteren Vaterlande gegen\n\u00fcber loyal, er f\u00fchlt sich eins mit den\nanderen Nationalit\u00e4ten, welche die weite\nDominion bewohnen, und begeistert\nsingt er die Hymne, welche Sir George\nEarlier vor 50 Jahren gedichtet hat:\n\u00dc, C:tnaea mon pays nies amours\n0 Canada, mein Land, dich lieben wir!\nWir kommen nun zu einem zweiten\nm\u00e4chtigen Element, den Canadier\u00bb eng'\nlischer Abstammung. W\u00e4hrend in der\nProvinz Quebec drei Viertel der Bev\u00f6l\nkerung franz\u00f6sischer Abstammung und\nsechs Siebentel Katholiken find, ist in\nden \u00fcbrigen Provinzen das gerade Ge\ngentheil der Fall. Die Provinz On\ntario z. B. wird zum gr\u00f6\u00dften Theil von\nenglischen, schottischen und irischen Ele\nmenten bewohnt. Ein Zehntel ist\nDeutsch und nur der zwanzigste Theil\nfranz\u00f6sisch. Es ist eine eigenth\u00fcmliche\nErscheinung, da\u00df Engl\u00e4nder, wenn sie\nsich in den Ver. Staaten niederlassen,\nvielfach das amerikanische B\u00fcrgerrecht\nnicht erwerben. Sie behaupten, da\u00df sie\nihre Lage dadurch nicht verbessern w\u00fcr\nden und ziehen deshalb vor, Untertha\nnen \u201eIhrer allergn\u00e4digsten Majest\u00e4t der\nK\u00f6nigin\" zu bleiben. Wenn nun ein\nEngl\u00e4nder sich in Canada niederl\u00e4\u00dft,\nso ist er eigentlich nicht ausgewandert,\nsondern er hat nur seinen Wohnsitz ver\n\u00e4ndert und bleibt nach wie tiov B\u00fcrger\njenes Weltreiches, in welchem die Sonne\nnie untergeht. Im Anschlu\u00df an sein\nVaterland f\u00fchlt er sich stark und ein\nB\u00fcrger dieses Reiches zu sein ist sein\nSto'z When\nthen I feel as if 1 could die far her,\"\nsagte einer meiner englischen Bekannten,\nein Mitglied der canadischen Miliz.\nVon den Schottl\u00e4ndern gilt nach mei\nner Erfahrung dasselbe. Als ich einst\neine Reise nach New Aork machte und\nmeine Reisegesellschaft in Prescott die\nblauen Flutherr des Lorenzo-Stromes\nbewunderte, lenkte einer der Mitreisen\nden unsere Aufmerksamkeit auf das auf\namerikanischer Seite liegende Oadens\nb\u00fcrg. Ach! es da ein alter Schott\nl\u00e4nder cuS, was ist denn da zu sehen\ndas ist eine ganz gew\u00f6hnliche Dankee\ntown. Die'es sagte er mit solch souve\nr\u00e4ner Verachtung, da\u00df jede weitere Er\nw\u00e4hnung untr\u00fcglich wurde.\nWas nun das irische Element anbe\nlangt, so sollte man meinen, da\u00df hier die\nmeisten Sympathien s\u00fcr die Ver. Staa\nten zu finden w\u00e4ren. Und in der That\ndie Jrl\u00e4nder haben auch Grund in dem\nAnschlu\u00df Canadas an die Ver. Staaten\neine Schw\u00e4chung Englands zu erblicken,\nDer Ire ha\u00dft England zu sehr, um nicht\njede Gelegenheit zur Sch\u00e4digung dessel\nben zu ergreifen. Nichtsdestoweniger\nf\u00fch er irrstinctiv, da\u00df er seine Lage da\ndurch nicht verbessern w\u00fcrde. Er genie\u00dft\nals canadischer B\u00fcrger alle Freiheiten,\nderen er sich als amerikanischer B\u00fcrger\nerfreuen w\u00fcrde, und noch mehr dazu\ndoch hiervon sp\u00e4ter.\nWenn wir von den Jrl\u00e4ndern spre\nchen, so d\u00fcrfe\u00bb wir einen Theil dieses\nVolkes nicht vergessen, dtr das gerade\nGegentheil von dem erstrebt, was fer\nerste Theil vielleicht unter Umst\u00e4nden\nw\u00fcnschen winde. Es sind die\u00df dieOra\nnier oder Orangemen, welche inCanada\nsehr zahlreich sind und gro\u00dfen Einflu\u00df\nbesitzen. Dieses fanatische Volk glaubt\nsich berufen, der W\u00e4chter der englischen\nUnterthanen zu fein. Sie haben das\nMmtopol aller Loyalit\u00e4t gepachtet und\nw\u00fcrden sich eher in St\u00fccke hauen lassen,\nals da\u00df sie eine Trennung Canadas von\nEngland zugeben w\u00fcrden. Als vor ei\nniger Zeit der irische Agitator O'Brien\nnach Canada kam, um LordLansdowne,\nden Vertreter der K\u00f6nigin, in Canada\nunm\u00f6glich zu machen, da waren es die\nOrangenien oben an, welche die gro\u00df\nartigsten Gegendemonstrationen veran\nstalteten, um O'BriensSendung zu ver\ntiteln, und ihre Schuld ist es nicht, da\u00df\ner Canada lebendig verlassen hat. Da\u00df\ner den Vertreter der K\u00f6nigin angegriffen\nhatte, das konnten sie ihm nicht verzei\nhen.\nDie Rechte und Freiheiten, deren sich\ndie Canadier jetzt erfreuen, mu\u00dften sie\nsich allerdings ertrotzen und zum theil\nauch erk\u00e4mpfen. Aber an Muth und\nAusdauer bat es ihnen 'wahrlich nicht\ngefehlt. Mehrmals versuchten die von\nEngland gesandten Gouverneure die Ca\nnadier zu behandeln wie die Isl\u00e4nder\nso im Jahre 1837, wo die englische Re\ngierung eine Petion um Ministerverant\nwortlichkeit ablehnend beschick. Da\nverweigerte die Legislatur von Unter\nCanada die Steuern, und bald kam es\nauch zu blutigen K\u00e4rnpsen zwischen den\nS\u00f6hnen der Freiheit und den Loyali\nsten. Die Ruhe wurde erst wieder her\ngestellt, als Ober- und Unter-Canada\nvereinigt wurden. Die Jahre 1847\n1849 sahen neue Unruhen, und damals\nzeigten sich offene Sympathien f\u00fcr die\nVer. Staaten. Je mehr aber die eng\ntische Regierung den Canadiern freie\nHand lie\u00df, desto mehr schwand auch die\nAgitation f\u00fcr einen Anschlu\u00df. H\u00e4tte\nEngend damals nicht die gr\u00f6\u00dfteM\u00e4\u00dfig\nrmg gezeigt, wer wei\u00df, was geschehen\nw\u00e4re. Im Jabre 1864 wurde der\n1 Vorschlag gernacht, da\u00df die (Moniert\nI Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia und\n[New Brunswick eine F\u00f6rderation bilden\n\"'V v\u00ab: JJiX. .^4\",\nT~\nsollten, was allgemeinen Anklang fand.\nManitoba wurde im Jahre 1870, Bri\ntish Columbia 1871 und Prince Ed\nward Island 1873 in den Bund anfge\nnommen. Zweifelsohne werden mit der\nZeit noch mehrere Provinzen aus den\nnordwestlichen Territorien gebildet wer\nden, und so hat auch Canada noch eine\ngro\u00dfe Zukunft vor sich. Ein monu\nmentales Werk darf hier nicht \u00fcbersehen\nwerden. Es ist dies die Canadian Pa\neiste Bahn, die zu dem Zweck gebaut\nwurde, um die \u00e4lteren Provinzen mit\nden Territorien zu verbinden. So se\nhen wir also in Canada verh\u00e4ltni\u00dfm\u00e4\u00dfig\nwenig Sympathie f\u00fcr eine Union. Man\ndarf eben nicht vergessen, da\u00df den Kin\ndem in der Schule schon das Bewu\u00dft\nsein beigebracht wird, da\u00df sie als B\u00fcr\nger der Dominion sich frei und gl\u00fccklich\nf\u00fchlen werden.\nJa, wenn Onkel Sam vor dem Jahre\n1864 mit feinen Liebeserkl\u00e4rungen her\nvorgetreten w\u00e4re, dann m\u00f6chte er mehr\nSympathie bei Mi\u00df Canada gefunden\nhaben. Seit aber die Confederation\nin's Leben gerufen wurde, haben die\nCanadier sich mit der Idee vertraut ge\nmacht, da\u00df sie als selbstst\u00e4ndige Nation\nganz gut fortbestehen k\u00f6nnen, und wenn\nje einmal eine Ver\u00e4nderung eintreten\nsollte, so w\u00e4re es die, da\u00df sie vielleicht\nihre Verbindung mit England l\u00f6sen\nw\u00fcrden, aber auch dieses w\u00e4re, wie der\nMontreal Star' bemerkt, nicht dasOpser\neines einzigen canadischen Freiwilligen\nwerth.\nNun w\u00e4re noch eine weitere Frage zu\ner\u00f6rtern, die besonders uns Katholiken\nsehr nahe ber\u00fchrt, und diese Frage lau\ntet Wie w\u00fcrden sich die Canadier nach\neiner etwaigen Annexion stellen. Um\ndieses zu beurtheilen, mu\u00df man vor\nallem im Auge behalten, da\u00df dieselben\nin ihrer jetzigen Lage sich aller Freihei\nten erfreuen, welcher die B\u00fcrger der\nVer. Staaten sich r\u00fchmen, mit Aus\nnahme der Erw\u00e4hlung eines General\nGouverneurs und der Ernennung des\ncommcmbtrenbeii Generals der Miliz.\nDiese beiden Beamten werden von der\nenglischen Regierung ernannt, ebenso\nhat die englische Regierung ein Veto\nRecht. Doch wird, wie schon bemerkt,\ndiese Oberherrschaft so wenig gef\u00fchlt,\nda\u00df sich kaum ein Dutzend Freiwilliger\nfinden w\u00fcrde, welche ihr Leben de\u00dfhalb\nin die Schanze schlagen w\u00fcrden. In\nden Augen der Canadier sind diese Vor\nrechte keinen Schu\u00df Pulver werth. Die\nenglische Regierung gebraucht threRechte\neben nicht despotisch. So sehr sie Jr\nland knechtet, so wenig mischt sie sich in\ndie innern Angelegenheiten Canada's.\nDie B\u00fcrger der Dominion erw\u00e4hlen\nihre Vertreter sowohl f\u00fcr die Provin\ncial- als auch f\u00fcr die F\u00f6rderal-Regier\nung. Die bei den Wahlen siegende\nPartei regiert thats\u00e4chlich und der Ver\ntreter der K\u00f6nigin hat sich mit den F\u00fch\nrern dieser Partei zurecht zu finden.\nDie gesetzgebenden Versammlungen\nmachen die Gesetze, bestimmen die\nSteuern, und \u00fcben so ziemlich alle Rechte\nvon einer gesetzgebenden Versammlung\naus.\nWas speciell die Katholiken anlangt,\nso haben sie ihre eigenen Schulen, die\nmit ihrem eigenen Gelde erhatten wer\nden. {Separate Schools.) Sie sind\nnicht verpflichtet zum Unterhalt der Pro\ntestanten oder Public Schulen beizu\nsteuern. Gewi\u00df ein bedeutender Vor\ntheil, den sie \u00fcber die Katholiken der\nVer. Staaten haben.\nDie Steuern, welche f\u00fcr Schulzwecke\nerhoben werden, gehen den Katholiken\nauch dann nicht verloren, wenn dieselben\nin der Miethe wohnen und die Hausei\ngenth\u00fcmer Protestanten sind, denn dann\nf\u00e4llt die Steuer an den katholischen\nSchulfond.\nWenn die Katholiken in der Provinz\nQuebec z.B. eine Pfarrkirche bauen wol\nlen, so hat die Provincial-Legislatur das\nRecht, das Eigenthum der Pfarrange\nh\u00f6rigen zu besteuern.\nIch frage nun, w\u00fcrden die B\u00fcrger\nder Ver. Staaten liberal genug sein, die\nCanadier in ihren Rechten und Privile\ngien zu belassen oder w\u00fcrde nicht viel\nmehr protestantisches Vorurtheil und\nFanatismus \u00fcber das Gef\u00fchl f\u00fcr Recht\nund Billigkeit den Sieg davon tragen\nDie Canadier k\u00f6nnten also in bezug auf\nFreiheit nichts gewinnen, wohl aber sehr\nviel verlieren. Wir wollen aber einmal\nden Fall fetzen, da\u00df Canada annectirt\nw\u00fcrde, oder freiwillig sich den Ver.\nStaaten anschlie\u00dfen wollte, so ist es doch\nundenkbar, da\u00df ersteres sich nicht mit\nH\u00e4nden und F\u00fc\u00dfen um seine wohler\nworbenen Rechte und Privilegien weh\nren w\u00fcrde und dann w\u00e4re allerdings f\u00fcr\nuns Katholiken eine bessere Zeit in Aus\nsicht, denn die Agitation \u00fcber die Rechte\nder canadischen Katholiken w\u00fcrde ohne\nZweifel auch unsere Rechte dem ameri\nkanischen Volke gegen\u00fcber in einem an\ndern und bessern Lichte erscheinen lassen.\nDas walte Gott!\nFr.

Es ist schade,\nin Vorarlberg zieht sich seit einiger Zeit\neine gewisse Spannung zwischen h\u00f6herer\nund niederer Geistlichkeit und Regier\u00ab\nungs- und Volk\u00e8kreisen hin. Die nie\ndere Geistlichkeit und das conservative\nVolk w\u00fcnschten einmal die Ausf\u00fchrung\nder p\u00e4pstlichen Bulle, wonach in Feld\nkirch ein selbst\u00e4ndigen Bisthumssitz ge\ngr\u00fcndet die h\u00f6heren geistlichen und\nweltlichen Kreise finden die Sache annoch\ninopportun.

Dauern die Dinge\nfort und sollten diese verbissenen Streit\nh\u00f6hne ihr Wesen dort weitertreiben, so\nm\u00f6chte auch Luzern gleich Genf im\nFremdenverkehr es zu f\u00fchlen bekommen,\nda\u00df die sch\u00f6ne Natur wohl anzieht, aber\nkirchlich-religi\u00f6se UngemiithUchteUen ab\nsto\u00dfen. Der Streit wird umso wider\nlicher, als die Regierung diesen sogen.\n\u201eAlttatHolifen\" (in Wahrheit sind es in\nMehrheit Protestanten oder Ungl\u00e4ubige,\ndenen dieManahilskirche als solche durch\naus gleichgiltig ist) eine h\u00fcbsche Summe\nofferirt hat, um eine eigene Kirche zu\nbauen. Das wollen sie aber nicht, sie\nbrauchen jr keine Kirche wo sie die\nwahren Katholiken aus ihren Kirchen\nvertreiben, da sind diese bald leer. Be\nk\u00e4mpfung der katholischen Kirche wie\ndes positiven Christenthums \u00fcberhaupt\nan Seite der protestantischen Reformer\nin den Kampfreihen der Freimaurer\nund Freigeister das ist Anfang und\nEnde dieser Seite. Sie sind ausge\nschlossen, h.'bm sich selber ausgeschlossen\nvon der katholischen Kirche, erkl\u00e4rte ihr\n\u201eBischof\" selber wiederholt sie r\u00fccken\nmehr und mehr in's Lager der Prote\nstanten.\nFr\u00fcher, als man die Katholiken eine\nZeit lang s\u00fcr verschiedene GeseMvor\nlagen bedurfte, da machte man Miene,\ndie Altkatholiken zur\u00fcckzustellen nun,\nnachdem der Mohr seine Pflicht gethan,\nkehrt man den Kern seines Wesens wie\nder heraus. Die profefsionsm\u00e4\u00dfigsn\nStreith\u00e4hne stehen vielen Protestanten\nund Radicalen eben n\u00e4her. In der\nReaction sind sie ja alle Eins. Nur so\nist es erkl\u00e4rlich, das eine .Neue Z\u00fcrcher\nZtg.' f\u00fcr die Sache der Altkatholiken\nzur Zeit plaidiren kann. W\u00fcr\nden die Altkatholiken gleich den Prote\nstanten sich f\u00f6rmlich ausscheiden, so\ndurfte sich selbst f\u00fcr den Simultange\ngebrauch einer Kirche ein Absinden tref\nsen lassen, wie es in erkl\u00e4rten parit\u00e4ti\nschen Gemeinden l\u00e4ngst besteht. An\nders aber m\u00fc\u00dfte jede Gemeinschaftlich\nkeit der Kirchen zur Verirmng der Gl\u00e4u\nbigen f\u00fchren!\nMan sagte mir, die Luzerner b\u00fc\u00dfen\nin dieser Geschichte gewisse S\u00fcnden!\nKirchliche H\u00e4upter nahmen leider zur er\nsten Zeit der Altkatholikenbewegung dort\neine eigenth\u00fcmliche Stellung ein,\nund das josephinische Kirchengesctz sei\nunter der gegenw\u00e4rtigen conservative\nRegierung nicht revidirt worden, wie\nwiederholt von kirchlich gesinnten Orga\nnen gefordert worden. Und nun die\nVerlegenheiten!\nIn der katholischen Schweiz regt sich's\naber gewaltig zu einer massenhaften ein\nm\u00fcchigen Gesumtbswegung, und so\nd\u00fcrfte der schweizerische Radicalisms\nsich zweimal besinnen, bevor er einen\nneuen und viel gewaltigern Cnlturkampf\nruft. Der frivole Angriff auf die Con\nst fsionsfchule, der man in keiner Bezieh\nung etwas anhaben kann, ruft eine all\ngemeine Entr\u00fcstung unter den Katholiken\nhervor. In St. Gallen r\u00fcstet man sich\nzu einer Verfassungsrevision, von der\nauch der friedliebende Bischof nicht ab\ngewunken hat.\n.Augsb. Postz.'\nDiejenigen, welche gesonnen sind, in\nDakota ihr Heim auszuschlagen, sollten\nsich baldm\u00f6glichst dazu entschlie\u00dfen, denn\ndas Land ist jetzt noch billig zu haben.\nMan kaust hier den Acre noch f\u00fcr $5\u2014\n10, wird aber nicht lange dauern, bis\ndas Land den doppelten Preis bringt.\nDas Land eignet sich sehr gut f\u00fcr Wei\nzen, Korn, Hafer, Kartoffeln u. s. to.\nBesonders gute Gelegenheit f\u00fcr Vieh\nz\u00fcchter, denn das Buffalo Gras ist sehr\nnahrhaft und ist un\u00fcbertrefflich f\u00fcr\nSchafe.\nKirchen und Schulen befin\nden sich in dieser Gegend schon \u00fcberall.\nWir m\u00f6chten w\u00fcnschen, da\u00df sich gute\ndeutsche Farmer hier ansiedeln.

Miller, oder John Schmitten\nRcdfield, Spink Co., Dak.\nKUlotKiulfer\nIn unserer letzten Anzeige Haien wir\n$20.50\nals den jetzigen billigsten Preis zwischen\nDeutschland und Amerika angezeigt. Da\nindessen gewisse Agenten das Publikum\nhinter's Licht zu sichren versuchen, indem\nsie durch zweideutige Anzeigen zu verstehen\nlassen, da\u00df dies der Preis nach Minneapo\nlis sei, d\u00fcrfen wir allen Billetverk\u00e4ufern\nden Rath geben, kein Handgeld an irgend\nwelchen Agenten einzusenden.\nAber es gibt andere Anzeigen-Kniffe wie\ndiese. Man sieht gewisse Agenten anzei\ngen, da\u00df fie Freikarten\nHS\u2014billiger\nwie alle anderen Agenten verkaufen. Falls\ndiese Behauptung der Wahrheit gem\u00e4\u00df\nw\u00e4re, w\u00fcrde nat\u00fcrlicherweise kein Anderer\nnur eine einzige Freikarte verkaufen k\u00f6n\nnen. Aber das rechte Sachverh\u00e4ltni\u00df ist'\nda\u00df es Freikarten verschiedener Art zwi\nschen New Aork und Minneapolis oder\nSt. Paul gibt.

The\nreduction amounts to between one-half\nnnd one point, and makes Uie yield from\n5.32 to 5.80 per cent In the various ma\nturities. Tightness of money has com\npelled some business men to sell their\nVictory bonds to ral.e working capital,\na fact which may lead to further de\npression of price.\nFor Issues of Provincial bonds the\nUnited States still proves a eood market,\nas shown by the quick absorption of tho\nOntario Issue ten days ngo, and by the\n(ale of a Saskatchewan tesue this week\nfor ultimate disposition in the same\nHeld. Tho Saskatchewan bonds, which\namounted to $1,000,000, were bought by\nAmes & Co. nnd the Dominion Securities\nCorporation of Toronto and Halsoy,\nStuart & Co. of Chicago. They arc for\nfour years and bear 6 per cent. At the\nIfcsue price of 102.20 the Province pajjs\n5.37 per cent, for Its money, running\nthe rifle later of adverse exchange\nagainst payments of Interest and princi\npal. Canadian banks have attracted more\nnotice of late than for many months.\nThree new sjock Issues have been an\nnounced, preparing the way doubtless\nfor larger extensions In the home and\nforeign fields and for the Issuo of more\ncredit to take care of growing necessi\nties. In addition to the new issue of\n$2,000,000 by tho Bank of Montreal, we\nhave had tho announcement of $3,400,000\nby the Royal Bank and-$3,100,000 by the\nMerchants' Bank. The total capital of\nthe three banks, when these Issues have\nbeen sold, will be: Montreal. $22,000,\n000; Royal, $20,100,000; Merchants,\n$10,500,000. Following these announce\nments there has been a greatly Increased\nInterest in bank shares, carrying the\nRoyal up to 231 on the Exchange and\nthe Merchants up, to 19.\nThe Pnperninklnff Industry.\nLittle flutters of national conscious\nness marked the week. It has been a\nmatter of pride that Canada's higher\nplaco In international affairs has been\nfollowed by steps to establish a Min\nister at Washington, Delays under Uie\nold system were bad enough, but the\nnew Idea fits In better with the country's\nnew pride, following achievements In the\nwar. with the recognition gained at the\npeace conference.\nSenator Underwood's criticism of the\nrestrictions on the export of pulp wood\nfrom Crown lands In the various ptov\nlnces have naturally Occasioned regret,\nbut have been attributed to the demand\nof certain interests across the line, who\nhave no consideration for the natural\ndesire of this country to develop a basic\nIndustry to a reasonable and economic\npoint.\nNotwithstanding the boom in 'paper\nmaking, recent developments In compa\nnies engaged In that industry have not\nrevealed fabulous profits. The Spanish\nRiver Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd., which\nhas 42 per cent of arrears on preferred,\nhas just announced that payment of\nthose arrears will be made by a stock\ndividend of preferred. Instead of even\npartially In cash, and that payment of\npreferred dividends will begin In July,\nPrice Brothers, operating a large paper\nmill In the Province of Quebec, report\nprofits for the year of $2,055.78.'.. an\nIncrease of $561,821. Their capital was\nIncreased last year from $5,000,000 to\n$8,534,200.\nProgress Is being reported from day\nto day in the formation of the big\nmerger of steel and ship companies. It\nIs now stated that the assets of the con\ncerns entering the combine exceed $400,-\n000.000 on a conservative valuation re\ncently made, and that the initial capital\nIssue will be about $700,000,000. On this\nbasis the arrangement appears to be\nremarkably free from \"water,\" If the\nvaluation Is as conservative ay Is stated.\nTho principal members of tho merger\nwill be Dominion Steel Corporation.\nCanada Steamship Lines, Nova Scotia\nSteel & Coal Company.

An examination of the po\nsltlon of Canadian stocks shows that,\nwith n fow exceptions, tho excessive\nspeculation which led to such a shako\nout on your sldo Is absent from these\nmarkets,\nNaturally there Is a lack of the darlnR\ncnaractcrs who stake ml llona on a move\nment In tho market, and there Is also\niacK or money with.whlch to carry on\nstock market buying. Toronto traders,\nat least, when they want tho thrill of a\nble speculation, taku It In Wall Street\nrather than on tho homo exchange. In\nlast week's operations they appear to\nhave been warned In time, and few, If\nI any, were caiiKht In tho break.\nI A distinguished Toronto banker who\n1 has visited New York and several largo\n' Canadian cities nf Inte oxpref.i? a hope\n1 ful view of tho position of this country.\n' He sees tho United States suffering from\nresident Wilson's Inaction on certain\nlines, and from tho dllllculty of tho\ncountry realizing Its hopes in foreign\n, trade through lack of pcaco or harmony\nI with certain important foreign nations.\nCanada on tho other hand, thouch\nheading for higher money rates, he bo-\n1 uovca to do m a sounder position. And\nthough tho bankers aro resolutely cur\n, tailing money for speculation ho Is con\nI fldent there will bo enough credit for\nI legitimate business. That credit Is now\n1 being carefully rationed out. Another\nToronto banker believes tho apex of\nprices has been reached, and hears of\nImportations of such things as carpets\nfrom Kngland because prices are lower.\nOverall Clulm In Cnnnda.\nWo have had the beginning of a public\ncampaign ugulnst high prices In the for\nmation of \"overall clubs.\" following the\nexample of American cities, and In pub\nlic meetings of women pledging them\nselves not to buy any potatoes for a\nmonth. Though these actions may not\ncalize the direct results anticipated, they\nare more significant as a protest which\nmay lead to rigid abstention from, un\nnecessary buying.\nv A unique Incident In tho bond market\nwas the sale of $6,800,000 Province of\nOntario bonds, which have since been\nabsorbed in the United States, the money\nbeing used to retire sterling bonds of\nthe province held In Great Britain\namounting to $3,515,000. By this trans\naction, tho province, taking advantage\nof the weakness of sterling exchange and\nof the opportunities for a sale at a favor\nable rate in tho United States, has made\na profit through doublo exchange of\nJl.715,000, thus reducing tho capital debt\nto that extent. The risk of exchange In\nNew York being still adverse when the\nbonds mature In five years must, of\ncourse, bo taken, but the venture Is dar\ning and may bo fully Justified. As a\npiece of financing by the Farmer-Labor\nGovernment It Is worth more than pass\ning notice.\nThe Provlnco of Manitoba sold a bond\nissue of S500.000 to Ames & Co., which\nalso will be disposed of in the United\nStates. When tho Province of Quebec\nopened Its tenders at the middle of the\nweek for a bond lssuo of S5. 000.000 tho\noffers were not high enought to suit the !\ntreasurer and negotiations havo been\nI proceeding to secure a better prlco. The\nrefusal of the offers Is evidence of tho\nchanged condition of the bond market,\nwhere lower prices and higher yields s\nuiu oovious icnaency.\nIndustry Continue Active.\nConfirming the reports of bankers and\ntrade organizations that Industry con-\nI unui-3 ncuvo m nearly an lines comes\na report that the Algoma Steel Corpora\ntion, u suosuuary or tno Lake Superior\nCorporation, had unfilled orders for 402.\n000 tons at the end of March.

Knappen, Secre\ntary of the Western Canadian Im\nmigration Association, Minneapolis,\nMinn., who will cheerfully supply in\nformation about Western Canada.)\nS\n&\n*mf\nTHE LAND\nBOUNTIFUL WHEAT\nWestern Canada is a new country.\nIt may not have any greater natural\nwealth and resources than an area\nof equal extent in the United States,\nbut -whatever it has is hardly touched.\nWhile\" the American west was filling\nup with people, Western Canada was\nleft almost uninhabited. Mighty\nwaves of population crossed the Mis\nsissippi south of the boundary and\nswept westwards from St. Vincent to\nNew Orleans, but in Canada west\nthe uninhabited stretched away end\nlessly Just as it had for oountless\nages. In the states the prairie grass\ngave way to wheat and corn, and the\nscattered tepees of the Indians were\nsuooeeded by populous citieB and\nfarms that occupied every foot of\narable land. In Western Canada a\nhandful of people were lost in an\nexpanse of 400,000 miles of good\ncountry, while great states sprang into\nexistence in the republic and received\ntheir stars in the flag. To-day there\nare 16,000,000 people west of the Mis\nsissippi tn the United States, while\nthere are less than a million in Can\nada west of I^ake Superior.\nJn a general way, the American\nwest has been occupied, its lands are\nbeing tilled, its mines are being\nopened, Its forests are being con\nverted into lumber, it has been over\nrun and occupied. It still has room,\nIt Is true, for millions, but it can no\nlonger claim to be a new country.\nWith Western Canada all is different.\nIn many respects it stands just where\nthe American west stood thirty or\nforty years ago, when a host of high\nspirited, ambitious, hopeful pioneers'\nwere orowding in to take possession\nof the land, extract its wealth, build\nthem homes and rear the great cities\nthat have been the marvel of the\nworld. There the land is yet unoc\ncupied, the .soil retains its virgin fer\ntility, the cities are yet to be builded.\nWhen all this is understood, it be\ncomes easy to understand the rest\nprovided you can get rid of the no\ntion that it la too cold in Canada Idti\nagriculture or comfortable existence?\nWestern Canada Rediscovered by Americans\nOne of the Richest Parts of the Continent\nLong Overlooked, Now Appreciated.\nAmericans Now Pouring in at Rate of 50,000\na yearA Soil of Unequalled Fertility\nProduces Best Quality of Wheat\nin Enormous Quantities.\nMeaning of \"Western Canada.\" |f\nIn speaking of Western Canada,\nreference is usually made to the prov\nince of Manitoba and the territories\nof Alberta, Assiniboia and Saskatche\nwan. Athabasca, Keewatin and Mac\nkenzie will all be heard from to some\nextent one day, but for the present the\nfour districts named are the only\nones to be considered because they are\naccessible and the others are not.\nBritish Columbia is a different region\nboth geographically and climatically.\nManitoba and the three territories\nhere considered have a total superficial\narea of near 400,000 square miles.\nTranslated into states, that means\nMinnesota, North and South Dakota,\nIowa, Wisoonsin and Ohio. The states\nnamed have a population of 11,000,000.\nDoes that not suggest some of the pos\nsibilities that lie before Western Cana\nda? \"Yes,\" you may say, 'fprovided the\nI soil be fertile and the climate suitable\nto comfortable and prosperous exist-\nence.\" Well, the soil is fertile and\nthe climate is one that agrees with\na hearty and vigorous peopleand\nthat is the kind of people Western\nCanada wants and is getting. A firm\nly fixed and long-entertained idea dies\nhard, even tho erroneous. The words\nnorth and northern are Western\nCanada's enemies. The United States\nhas a north, where the winters are\npretty stiff, thereforeso runs the\nreasoning in the popular mindCana\nda, which is still farther north, must\nbe a good place to stay away from.\nNow the fact is that even in the east\nern part of Western Canada \"northing\"\ndoes not mean \"colding,\" to any great\nextent. Granted that the mean\nannual temperature of Winnipeg is a\nfew degrees colder than that of. St.\nPaul, does it follow that the climate\nof Winnipeg is not good? The\nwinters are cold, but the summers are\nwarm the days of the crop season\nlong and bright, and the season itself\nquite long enough to mature the crops.\nAs for the winters, what difference\ndoes two or three weeks, more or less,\nwinter mean, and who can tell the\nifference a little more cold makes\nexcept with the mercury, which does\nnot register sensible cold. These\nslight differences do not weigh against\nthe cheap but exceedingly rich lands\nwheat yields of twenty to forty bush\nels to the acre and the countless op\nportunities of a new and growing\ncountry.\nThe New Age.\nWestern Canada's long sleep has\npassed. Now begins the new age, the\nage of population influx, of increasing\nacreage of tilled lands, of railway\nbuilding, of village and city building.\n1\nMM*.'\n'i SVJ\nNow shall we see repeated In Mani\ntoba, Assiniboia, Alberta and Sas\nkatchewan the scenes that are famil\niar to western Americans. The uh\ntilled land will be tilled, the lonely\ncountry will become populous, monu\nment-like elevators rise on the flat\nface of the prairie and smoking fac\ntory chimneys will tell of industry.\nInto this new country the sons of toil\nare now flocking a hundred thousand\nstrong each year. From eastern\nCanada and Europe come 50,000 and\nfrom the United States 50.0D0. And\nthey will come in greater numbers.\nIt is a poor man's countrya country\nwhere with industry and frugality he\nmay become wealthy. As the number\nof the industrious but ambitious poor\nis legion, it is only a question of mak\ning them understand what western\nCanada offers to make them hurry \"to\nget in on the ground floor.\"\nThere may be some sentimental re\ngret in the United States that so good\nly a country should not be a part of\nthe union, and that American men and\nmoney are assisting in building up a\nforeign country. But it is in the blood\nfpr Americans to enter into a new\ncountry, and if any person is so sit\nuated in the United States that he can\nsee a way to improve his condition by\nemigrating to western Canada, he' can\nhardly be prevented from going. Be\nsides there is another way of looking\nat it. Since we have and are to have, a\nforeign country to the north, it is to\nour interest to have its inhabitants a\npeople of our own kind and a friendly\npeople. If our own flesh and blood\nare to make up a large part of the\npopulation of western Canada we shall\nbe better off than as If that/reglbn\nwas to be filled up with an uftfriendly\npeople. Again, the population of the\nUnited States is increasing so rapidly\nthat 50,000 or even 100,000 people\nemigrating each year to Canada will\nhardly be missed. Their places are\nquickly filled and the big republic\ngoes on adding 1,500,000 a year to its\npopulation.\nThe .Canadian west is no longer a\nland with a future only. It now has\na present, active, prosperous and giv\ning assurance of still better years to\ncom?. Thousands of acres of the\nbroad, prattles that, within-the-smejirw\nory of many of the present dceupants\nwere the pasturage-of herds of buffalo,\nhave been brought within the domain\nof the plow, and are now producing\nfpod for the world and wealth for\ntheir owners. It is no longer a land\non trial, for the foreseen future has\narrived, and It more than fulfils the\nmost sanguine prophecies made\ntwenty-five years ago respecting the\npossibilities of the country. There\nwas a time when the mention of 'the\nCanadian west was associated in the\npopular mind with the life of the\ntrapper and the hunter. To-day the\nmention of Canadian west suggests\nfields of golden grain, huge elevators\nthat dot and dominate the landscape,\nand the homes of thousands of pros\nperous and progressive farmers.\n.The Canadian west is Empire-like\nin extent. The single province of Man\nitoba alone has an area of 47,188,48,0\nacres, and of this it is estimated that\nthere are available for farming pur\nposes fully 25,000,000. But the Can\nadian west includes, not merely Man\nitoba, but all the country westward to\nthe Rocky mountains, and excluding\nthe unorganized districts, it extends\nnorthward from the international\nboundary for six or seven hundred\nmiles. Within the limits of Manitoba\nand the three territories, Assiniboia,\nAlberta and Saskatchewan, is an area\nof 135,000,000 acres of the most pro\nductive farming land in the world,\nand of this only 4,000,000 acres are,\nunder cultivation.\nRapid Growth.\nTo show the rapidity with which\nthis rich country is being settled, it\nmay be stated that in the year 1871\nthe total population was only 16,695.\nBy 1881 It had grown to 118,706 and\niby 1891 to 251,482. The census of\n1901 showed that the population of\nManitoba and the three territories was\n466,860, and to-day there are almost 50\nper cent more than that, for settlers\nfrom the United States, from Great\nBritain, from Norway, Sweden, Den\nmark and Iceland, from Germany and\nAustria, and from almost every Euro\npean country have been pcuring in at\nthe rate of thousands per month. Last\nyear more than 128,000 came to Can\nada, and it is certain, to judge by the\nnumber of arrivals thus far in 1904,\nthat this large number will be greatly\nexceeded this season.\nGroivth of Wheat Crops.\nThe development of the Canadian\nwest can be measured by the inorease\nin Its wheat crops. Wheat is king\nthere. It reigns ever an area greater\nthan that which acknowledges the\nsway of the German emperor.

The Canadian west's average\nconstitutes a record among the wheat\nproducing sections of the American\ncontinent.\nThe following statistics will show\nmore clearly than columns of descrip\ntion the development and fertility of\nWestern Canada. Take, first, Mani\ntoba. The yield of grain thruout this\nprovince for 1903 was officially report\ned as 102,401,088 bushels, as compared\nwith 98,108,047 bushels in 1902, and\n85,17a,858 in 1901 and 41,000,000 in\n189J.. .The wheat crop for 1903 is\nplaced at 50,290,947 bushels, as\nagainst 63,077,267 in 1902, 50,602,086\nin 1901 and only 23,191,399 in 1891.\nThe increase of acreage, tho very\nSHEEP ON A RANCH AT CRANE LAKE, N. W. T.\ngathered large'for the past five years, was lar\nfrom the fact tha.t in the province of\nManitoba, where the government has\nfor more than twenty years carefully\ncompiled the crop reports, the average\nyield of wheat per acre Is within a\nfew pounds of .twenty bushels. Two\nyears ago the average wheat crop of\nthe province was twenty-five bushels\nto the acre. Wheat has been threshed\nat the Indian Head experiment farm\nthat averaged sixty-two bushels to\nthe acre, and yields of whole farms\naveraging from thirty to forty bush\nels to the acre are quite frequent. The\nsuperior productiveness of the Cana\ndian west in respect to-wheat growing\nis easily proven by comparing it with\nthat of the wheat-growing states of\nthe American union. Dakota's aver\nage is thirteen bushels Iowa and Ne\nbraska between eleven and twelve\nWisconsin's is 1.3% and Minnesota's I in 1899, 411,864 in 1900, 504,697 in\nger from 1902 to 1903 than in any pre\nceding year, and had the average yield\nper acre been as large as. in former\nyears, the crop of 1903 would have\nbeen almost double that of 1902. The\nyield per acre in 1903 was 16.1 bush\nels, against 24.15 in 1902 and 25.23 in\n1901. The highest average yield in\nthe province was in 1895, when it\nreached 27.86 bushels. _\"-.\n'Wheat In tne Territories.\nThe three territories of Assiniboia,\nAlberta and Saskatchewan grew 14.-\n987,000 bushels of wheat from,584,988\nacres in 1902 10,961,700 bushels of\noats from 216,152 acres, and 906,000\nbushels of barley from 29,772 acres.\nThe increase in the wheat acreage is\nshown by the fact that it has grown\nfrom 307,580 acres in 1898, to 363,523\nFigures that Talk for Western Canada\n'Total Wheat Crop in 1902, 68,000,000 Bushels\n\"Average Yield Per Acre in 1902\nMnnifnhA I! 26 Bushels\nv. ^Territories 4 22.3 Bushels\nTerritories (1901).... ......,...._.%. .V.,...\nAverage for-Ten Years- i _, .\"&:\"**''. \\'\"'i'-r\nManitoba* ....W.... ...21.5\n^v \"---w- Territories (Six ye*i**& .U^i.r ii/^^,.,^ ..^..7\".: 19.42.Bushelst BusheL\nyw Minnes6ta :(Sest s^n|\"wiieat:sta^)' V.,': 14.2 \"Bushels\nll V\nWestern Canadian Grain Creeps in 1903\nTotal Acreage SSS&y.SSSSS 5,073424 Acres\nManitoba... .3,689,990\nTerritories.. .1,383,430\nWheat,\nBushels.\n40,116,878\nWhy do Americans go to Western Canada in such numbers?\nTo share in the abounding prosperity of anew country.\nCheap lands or free homesteads.

For more than three hun\ndred years there has always been a\nwest on this continent a land of op\nportunity and promise toward which\nthe restless, dissatisfied, ambitious and\nhopeful have turned their eager eyes\nand their willing feet. A great part\nof the cause of the wealth, prosperity\nand glorious achievements of the\nAmerican people has been due to the\nfact that they have been continuously\navailing themselves of the virgin re\nsources of a new country. But now\nthe tide of immigration has long\nsince crossed the Mississippi and the\nMissouri, ascended the mountains and\ndescended to the Pacific. Here and\nthere, it is true, there still remain\ncomparatively Jarge areas of cheap\nland which may be cultivated without\nirrigation.\nThe undertaking by the federal gov\nernment of irrigation on a large scale\nwill eventually regain from the desert\nperhaps 200,000,000 acres of land, and\nprovide homes for 75,000,000 people,\nbut the cheap lands that may be culti\nvated without artificial watering are\nbecoming scarcer each year, and there\nremain practically no homesteads\nwithin the humid regions outside of\nforest lands.\nIt is not strange, therefore, that\npublic attention should in recent years\nhave been strongly attracted to west\nern Canada. The people who are de\nsirous of finding new homes for them\nselves or their children, have sudden\nly awakened to the fact that north of\nthe forty-ninth parallel there is a\ncountry of great natural wealth and\nimperial extent.

In all such differences,\nhowever, for the sake of ultimate harmony,\nthe healing power of tolerance, comrade\nship and love must be ill owed to play its\npart.\nQueen Elizabeth II\nChristmas Day, 1956\nPeruvian Leader\nPays Tribute To\nRenowned Painter\nBy Thomas M.

C.\nIn the sixteenth century when\nthe Spaniards conquered Peru\nI they put an abrupt e'nd to an\nextraordinary civilization that\nhad developed in the high\nlands of the Andes.\nIt had its origins in th\u00bb\ntenth century when the lii*\noas, one of many tribes liv\ning in the region, took pos\nsession of the two-mile\nhigh valley of Cilsco.\nThus began a pattern of\nI conquest that, by 1534. when\nthe chief Inca fell victim to\nthe trickery of Pissarro, had\nproduced a wealthy, well-or\nganized empire stretching\ni from what is now Colombia\nto the northern part of Chile.\nIt covered almost 400,000\nsquare miles and included de\nsert and jungle, coastal low-,\nlands and the upland valleys\nand snowcapped peaks of the\nAndes cordillera.\nIncas Great Organisers\nThe Inca* were great or\nganizers they created an em\npire that was tightly knit\neconomically and politically.\nThey were excellent build\ners although they had no\nwheel, no mortar and no iron\ntools and many of their\nfortresses and other struc\ntures still stand despite the\nearthquakes common to the\nregion.\nHowever they left less evi\ndence of themselves and their\nculture in the sculptural em\nbellishment of their imperish\nable stone walls than did the,\nMayans of Central America.\nE a v a i o n s i n e u i n s o i\nprehistoric Peruvian i i e s\nand studies by Philip Ains-!\nworth Means, Wendell C.\nBennett, Julio C. Tello (an\nInca descendant) and other\narchaeologists and scholars\nhave helped to pierce the\ngloom of the centuries.\nAnd no\u00ab' comes Kristian\nKrekovic, a painter who,\nafter exhaustive study of\nthe authorities, has\nbrought the legendary and\nliving inhabitants of this\nfabulous land to life in a\nseries of monumental can\nvases which had their first\nUnited States showing at\nthe Smithsonian Natural\nHistory Building in Wash\nington in 1955.\nKrekovic, a native of Bos\nnia, fled the Balkans during\ne w a s o u e u e i n e\nAmericas, and, having become\nenamored with the culture of!\nI ancient Peru, finally made\nPeru his adopted country\ni through citizenship.\nLegend Of Manco Capac\nIn presenting the artist at\nI the opening, His Excellency,.\nI Ambassador Senor Don Juan\nBautista de Lavalle, Peruvian\nRepresentative to the Organ\nization of American States,\nremarked:\n\"As we look on the paint\nings hung here, there\ncomes to mind the symbolic\nlegend of Manco Capac,\nsent to earth by his father,\nthe Sun, with the mission\nof civilizing his people and\nuniting his brothers in the\ntasks of peace.\n\"Manco Capac carried a\ngolden staff, with instructions\nto traverse the land and to\nfound the capital of his em\npire where the staff disap\npeared into the earth.\n\"I think that we may say\nthat Krekovic has fulfilled a\nsomewhat similar mission in\nthe field of art, and that, in-\nGolden Brush of Kristian Krekovic\nstead of using a staff, he has\nbrought to life with golden\nbrush 'the ahcient Peruvian\ncultures and the former Inca\nEmpire, whose splendor has\nbeen revived in the fascinat\ning beauty of his painting.\"\nShadow Of Dinaric Alps\nThe vicissitudes of life dur\ning the past two decades have\nwrought strange and unpre\ndictable changes in the lives\nof millions of people.\nWhen Kristian Krekovic\nwas born in 1901 in Koprivna,\nBosnia, Yugoslavia, in the\nevening shadow of the Dina\nric Alps, how improbable it\nseemed that the njaelstrom of\n'war would one day cast him\nu o n a r- a w a y e u v i a n\nshores''\nBut there were mam' tran\nquil years before that fate\nful bombing of Belgrade when\nthe commodious home over\nlooking the Danube, built for\nhis wife, a noted French pi\nanist, was demolished and the\nfruits of his life's work burn\ned to ashes.\nHe was busy painting\nmurals for civic buildings,\npainting portraits of royal\nty\u2014Queen Mary of Eng\nland, Queen Maria of Rou\nmania and King Gustaf V\nof Sweden.\nHe was dreaming of a pa\nlatial cultural center, dedica\nted to freedom and tolerance\namong nations and religions,\nwhere philosophers, law-giv\ners, and humanitarians of all\nraces, creeds and countries\nmight be memoralized in mu\nral paintings.\nSun His Father\nWith \"Canada Ho!\" As Its 1957 Battlei-rv\nPITTSBURGH During!\nthe Christmas holidays, at\nyear-end, we are wont to\na u s e i n e e i o n o v e\nevents which have occurred\nin our private and social lives\nThe progress of the organi-1\nzation's various branches of\noperation will be most evi\ndently shown in the statistics\nin our official reports which\nwill be submitted to the In\nsurance Departments in the\nStates and Provinces of Can\nada early in 1957.\nIn that report, we will\nshow that the total mem\nbership of the organization\nat the close of the year will\nhave reached, for the first\ntime, 198 thousand, mem-\nKristian Krekovic's Croatian Peasant\nThe tragedy of 1939 and\nthe six years' holocaust con\nsumed this ambition' as it\nlaid waste his dwelling.

Dupont, of' the Department\nof tho Olse.-presldcnt of tho French Ex\npositions Committee, havo organized an\nextensive nralect for reestablishing com\nmerelal relations between France and\nCanada. Both French and Canadian com\nmercial men are united In a plan to re\nODcn the markets of Canada to the\nproducts of thla -war devastated country\nand to this end promises have been mado\nbv tho former to do everything In their\npower to assist In tho reconstruction\nand the economic unbuilding or ranee\nTho principal articles exported from\nFranco to Canada before the war were\nluxuries and art goods, and the statistics\nof the French Government reveal some\nfarts in this connection. In\n1909 the value of French exports to\nnnnnnr, in 1913. $15.-\n500,000. In 1908 tho value of French\nImports from Canada wero 11,800,000,\nwhllo In 1916 the Importations from\nCanada reached a total or su,uvu,uuu.\nFrench exports to Canada dropped to\ni.u ih,n a nun nnn in that vear.\nTho prlncl'pat articles of export from\nFranco to Canada Include church bells\nbooks, papers, pastries,- auiomounes,\ncotton goods, cloth, embroideries, velours,\ndrugs, chomlcals. dyes, earthenware,\npottorles, porcelain, plumes, statues,\nlaces, toys, fruits, glassware, hats, metal\nware, mineral waters, olive oil, paint\nings, water colors, engravings, perfumes,\nprecious stones, cheese, poultry, game,\nsilks, ribbons, textures, wines, liquors\nand woolen goods. Tho chief Imports to\nFrance from Canada were horses, cattle,\ncereals, fish, machinery, metals, min\nerals and lumber.\nDrop In Exportation.\nWhllo a noteworthy drop was re\ncorded In tho exportation from Franco\nto Canada during the war years, a pro\njxirtlonately much greater Increase Is\nnoted In the Importations from Canada,\ntho Increase In several Instances being\nfrom ten to twenty times what It was\nbefore tho war. To restore tho French\ncommercial balance with Canada, lost\nas a result of the war, Is tho purpose\nof the project Just launched.\nOne stumbling block encoojtered at\ntho outset by tho backers of this enter\nprise for the regeneration of Franco as\na potential commercial factor In 1U\nrelations with Canada Is the disinter\nestedness of the French Government\nItself. While hymns of production have\nbeen chanted all over France, nothing\nhas been done to permit French expor\ntatlons to Canada.\nIn 1917 Senator Beaublen came to\nFrance with a proposition for strength\nening the commercial relations between\ntho two countries by means of the Inter\nchange of exposition trains bearing for\nexhibition purposes the products of the\ntwo countries. Tho minister of public\n1-orks of France, however, was unable\nto furnish tho eight or ten cars ntces\nB.iry for this purpose and the plan fell\nthrough. Then a credit of $25,000,000\nwas opened by Canada for France to\nfacilitate the transportation here from\nCanada of products most needed for tho\nrehabilitation of the devastated regions.\nOnly $10,000,000 of this credit has been\nutilized so far.\nCanadian firms offered to construct\nhomes in tho war torn zones of France,\ngranting a Ave year credit, but IT.\nLoucheur, the Minister of Industrial Re\nconstruction, refused the offer.\n. Tlan exposition Train.\nNotwithstanding these rebuffs tho\nCanadian friends of Franco have ar\nranged for an exposition train of French\nproducts, which will tour Canada in the\ncoming year; all tho expenses of this\ntrain will bo defrayed by tho Canadians,\nand the French firms desiring to ex\nhlt have only tq pack their goods and\nplace them aboard ship. Transportation\nto Canada, as well as all Import duties,\nwill be paid by the Canadians. The ex\nhibition train' will make a trip of more\nthan eight thousaand miles and tho ex\npenses will bo met In part by moving\npicture shows put on at different stop\nping places.\nTho train will start next spring from\nMontreal over the Grand Trunk road,\nstopping at Brockvllle, Kingston, Bell\nvllle, Cobourg, Toronto, Palmerston,\nWoodstock, Chatham, Windsor, Niagara,\nHamilton, Northbay, thence over the\nTanadlan Pacific to Fort William and\nWinnipeg, and then traversing the\nCanadian prairies and tho Rockies to\nthe Pacific coast, returning to Montreal\nand Halifax. It Is expected that this\nproject will do much to restore the com\nmercial balance of Franco with the\n! ranee of America.\"\nSUBWAY LOOP PLAN INDORSED.\nFifth Avcnno Aaaoclutlon Favors\nucjHeraeni or Shuttle.\nTho subway loop plan advocated by\nthe Thlrty-fourth Street Board of Trade\nhas been Indorsed by the executive com\nmittee of the Fifth Avenue Association,\naccording to an announcement made\n(.'sterday.\nTho loop plan calls for the replace\nment of tho present shuttle by a loop\nfanning from Grand Central to Times\nfauare, down Seventh avenue to Thir\ntieth street, across this street and up\nt(j Grand Central again.

C., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1935 NUMBER 77\nOur New Trade Agreement With Canada\n\u2014 \u2014^ -!_\nLumber Takes Rap,\nSome Industries\nGiven Boost\nBy WILLIAM C. UTLEY\nIN 1929 we exported to Canada\ngoods valued at $900,000,000.\nFrom our northern neighbor\nwe imported $545,000,000 worth\nor goods. In 1934 our Canadian ex\nports amounted to $300,000,000 and\nour Canadian imports $233,000,000.\nWas this falling off in trade a re\nsult of the depression? Or was the\ndepression a result of the falling\noff in trade (with other countries\nas well as Canada, of course?)\nThese questions are best answered\nby another one: Which came first\u2014\nthe chicken or the egg?\nIf your business is one not im\nmediately affected by tariffs and\ntrade agreements and such goings\non, and you would answer yes to\nthe first question, it is not likely\nthat you approve of the new recip\nrocal trade agreement with Canada,\nwhich goes Into effect January 1,\n1936. If your business is not im\nmediately affected, and you would\nanswer yes to the second question,\nthe chances are you do approve.\nIf your business is immediately\naffected by the treaty, your approv\nal or disapproval is likely to depend\nupon whether you stand to lose\nmoney or make money by it.\nThe chances are you will find the\ntreaty a little annoying if you are\na lumberman, dairyman, whisky\nmanufacturer, cattleman or (with\ncertain reservations) farmer. You\nwill probably like It if you are a\nmanufacturer of farm machinery,\nelectrical goods, automobiles or\nradios; a citrus-fruit or cotton\ngrower, or a magazine publisher.\nConsumers Will Like It.\nYou are almost sure to like it If\nyou are \u201cjust a plain consumer\u201d or\na politician. For the consumer, it\nwill mean some reduction in prices.\nThe politician, if he be against the\nRoosevelt administration, will fin'd\ncertain definite disadvantages to\npounce upon publicly; if he be In\nfavor of the New Deal, he will find\ncertain definite advantages to l rag\nabout publicly.\nFor the new pact signed in Wash\nington by President Roosevelt and\nMackenzine King, shortly after Can\nada\u2019s new premier was elected, Is\nthe very epitome of Secretary of\nState Cordell Hull\u2019s policy of secur\ning recirocal trade agreements with\nforeign nations on the most-favored\nnation basis. It is the seventh such\nagreement to become effective, since\nwe had previously signed reciprocal\nagreements with Belgium, Brazil,\nColombia, Cuba, Haiti and Sweden.\nIt is the first time we have used\nthe quota system in a trade agree\nment.\nIn signing an agreement with the\nUnited States under the Hull pol\nicy, a foreign nation promises that\nif it gives any concessions to any\nother nation or nations, such con\ncessions will automatically become\neffective with regard to the United\nStates. We reciprocate by making\nthe same promise.\nBy the new pact Canada gives us\n\u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d rating. But\nIn the light of the concessions the\nUnited States made on 53 different\nitems, Canada is certainly the na\ntion most favored by the agreement,\nIn the opinion of some public fig\nures, such as former President\nHoover, who said: \u201cIt means still\nlarger Imports of foreign food. I\npresume It Is more of the abundant\nlife\u2014for Canadians.\u201d\nSecretary of Agriculture Wallace\nwas not long In making reply to\ncharges of hurting the farmer:\n\u201cThe attempt which Is now being\nmade to arouse special groups is,\nin the main, being led or Inspired\nby the same enemies of agriculture\nwho, in the guise of helping agri\nculture with higher tariffs on farm\nproducts brought enactment of the\nHawley-Smoot bill with its exorbi\ntant industrial rates and its sequel\nof lessened farm markets.\u201d\nIncluded in the Canadian conces\nsions of the new treaty are special\nStates concessions were a reduction\nof one-third to one-half in the duties\non the first 155,799 heavy beef cat\ntle (about three times our import\nfrom Canada during the first nine\nmonths of 1934), 51,933 calves less\nthan 175 pounds each (this quota\nis about 1 per cent of the American\nannual calf slaughter) and 20,000\ndairy cattle imported each year; a\n20 per cent to 40 per cent tariff cut\non the first 750,000 bushels of seed\npotatoes each year; a cut of 43 per\ncent for the first 1,500,000 gallons\nof cream; a reduction of 50 per cent\nin the duty on whisky aged four or\nmore years in the wood, and a 50\nper cent cut on lumber (Douglas fir\nand western hemlock were limited\nat a time when the Industry is al\nready over-manned. Another ven\ntured the guess that 4,000,000 man\nhours of employment annually would\nbe turned over to cheaper Canadian\nlabor. Southern lumbermen saw\nprice reductions which give them\nmore competition.\nMilk Industries Complain.\nOfficials of milk associations\nviewed the pact as disastrous. To\nthem Secretary Wallace pointed out\nthat cream imports are to be limit\ned to 1,500,000 gallons annually,\nwhereas, during 1925 and 1926 they\nwere 25,000,000 gallons.\nPotato growers in Maine had\ncause for alarm, with the tariff on\nCanadian potatoes reduced from 60\nA momentous international event was the signing of the new trade agreement with Canada, in the office\nof President Roosevelt. Left to right are pictured Secretary of State Cordell Hull, Prime Minister Mac\nkenzie King and the President, as they signed the pact, with United States cabinet members in the background.\nreductions or abolition of duties on\n180 Items which Canada Imports\nfrom us. Most Important among\nthe reductions were 50 per cent on\nagricultural machinery; 25 to 80\nper cent on other machinery; 25 to\n50 per cent for meat; 50 per cent\nfor grapefruit; 12% to 25 per cent\non automobiles, and similar reduc\ntions for electric refrigerators, wash\ning machines and radios. Canada\nagreed to keep on the free list or\nanges (during the first four months\nof the year), magazines, raw cotton,\nand certain vegetables (not staples),\nand to lower duties on several minor\nmanufactured products and surgical\ndressings.\nStops Unfair Practice.\nCanada agreed to retire a prac\ntice that has been the source of\nsome annoyance to American mer\nchants, especially those In cities\nnear the border. That was the use\nof powers under the tariff laws to\nplace arbitrarily high prices upon\nimported goods. Further, Canada\nwill now permit her tourists to\nbring home $100 worth of goods\nfrom the United States duty free, a\nconcession which has set up a few\nhowls from the dealers at home.\nAmong the Important United\nto 2dO,000,000 board feet annually).\nThere were numerous additional\nduty reductions on comparatively\nunimportant products ranging from\nlacrosse sticks to pipe organs for\nchurches. Certain wood products,\nminerals, skins and sea foods were\nkept on the free list.\nLoudest of all the lamentations\ncame from the lumber industries in\nthe United States. Indeed, 50,000\nunion workers In the timber forests\nand lumber mills of the Pacific\nNorthwest threatened to strike in\nprotest even before the terms of\nthe agreement became known.\nThese Industries, it was apparent,\nwere expecting to be the hardest\nhit, and events justified their expec\ntations. The general feeling was\nthat lumber had been offered on the\nsacrificial block that conditions\nmight be bettered for other Indus\ntries. Senator McNary of Oregon\nleft Immediately for Washington,\nclaiming that his mail-was includ\ning 1,000 letters of protest a day.\nMichigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota,\nas well as southern pine and cypress\nstates also are affected. One manu\nfacturer estimated that the price of\nCanadian lumber would be cut from\n$1.25 to $1.75 per 1,000 board feet\n' cents a bushel to 45 cents. Like\nwise, New England manufacturers\nof maple syrup had cause for com\nplaint. Manufacturers of farm ma\nchinery, steel, glass and petroleum\nwere jubilant.\nThe opinion of 1,000 manufac\nturers was voiced in the words of\nJohn W. O\u2019Leary, president of the\nMachinery and Allied Products insti\ntute, who said:\n\u201cThe United States sold about $15,\n500,000 worth of machinery to Can\nada in 1934, a gain of 74 per cent over\n1933, as compared to a gain of only\n42 per cent for Great Britain, our\nchief competitor.- This was despite\nthe great competitive disadvantage\nof the duty of 30 to 35 per cent on\nour machinery.\nReduces Competitive Disadvantage.\n\u201cThe new duty of 20'to 25 per\ncent and less In cases of some spe\ncial machinery reduces the com\npetitive disadvantage and should\ngive substantial impetus to machin\nery sales In Canada, making pos\nsible proportionate re-employment\nIn our capital goods industries\nwhere an Important portion of all\nemployment In the United States\nstill exists.\u201d\nIn Canada, too, there was some\nopposition, although stocks in To\nronto were somewhat strengthened\nafter the announcement, indicating\nperhaps that some of the hue and\ncry in both nations was the nat\nural reaction to be expected when\nany kind of important diplomatic\nstep is undertaken by a govern\nment. Canadian conservatives were\nof tlie opinion that It gained too\nlittle for Canada and too much for\nthe United States. Among their\nfavorite objections were:\nIts failure to secure any con\ncessions for the cod and haddock\nfishing industries of the maritlmes. '\nIts failure to secure a market for\nfood potatoes for all the provinces\nof eastern Canada.\nIts failure to secure concessions\nfor the dairying Industry of On\ntario and Quebec other than a quota\non cream and cheese.\nIts failure to do anything to as\nsists the marketing of Canadian\nwheat and other grains and flour.\nSectional reception of the treaty\nin the United States was varied.\nIn New England, some truck farm\ners were pleased over concessions\ngiven by Canada on a few vege\ntables, while potato growers were\nup in arms. Manufacturers of many\nfactory products were elated over\nthe new market created, and ship\npers were friendly toward the pact\nbecause the most-favored-nation\nclause allows goods bound for Can\nadan ports to enter North America\nthrough United States ports and\ncross the Canadian line without\nduty.\novine ocuuunai opinions.\nIn Michigan and Wisconsin, the\nagricultural and lumber bodies were\nconsiderably chagrined by the\ntreaty\u2019s terms, while automobile and\nfurniture manufacturers were sure\nit would stimulate trade and create\njobs.\nIn the corn belt the general feel\ning, if there was one, was hard to\ndefine with any degree of certainty.\nIndividual feeling depended much\non what each farmer\u2019s specialty\nwas. Range cattle Interests, for\nInstance, did not like the provision\nwhich would admit Canadian feed\ner cattle, but corn growers saw\nsome advantage In it.\nSeed potato growers in Minnesota\nwere certain that the business\nwould be seriously affected, but\ntable potato growers In Kansas saw\na better Canadian market ahead.\nThe Winnipeg Free Press may\nhave struck somewhere near the\ntruth when It said: \u201cThe effec\ntiveness of the trade agreement can\nbe judged by the vigor of the yells\nof disapproval by which it has been\ngreeted.\u2019\u2019\nMeanwhile, Secretary Hull went\nright ahead with his plans for open\ning up United States trade, and\nsubsequently stimulating world'\ntrade by negotiating for more\ntreaties along the same lines.\nFrancis B. Sayre, assistant in\ncharge of treaties on foreign trade,\nestimated that there were, In all,\nabout 29 nations with whom it was\npossible for the United States to\nreach an agreement on the most-fa\nvored-nation basis.\nA note of mystery which will not\nbe cleared up for a few weeks con\ncerns George N. Peek, former ad\nviser to the President on foreign\ntrade. President Roosevelt appoint\ned him to make a study of the new\nCanadian pact. After a superficial\nexamination of it, he offered the\nPresident his resignation.\n\u2022 Western Newspaper Union. ^", "batch": "ncu_juniper_ver01", "title_normal": "roanoke rapids herald.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/2017236974/1935-12-12/ed-1/seq-15.json", "place": ["North Carolina--Halifax--Roanoke Rapids"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 5, "county": ["Cass"], "edition": "Evening ed.", "frequency": "Daily (except Sunday)", "id": "/lccn/sn85042224/1908-08-04/ed-1/seq-5/", "subject": ["Cass County (N.D.)--Newspapers.", "Fargo (N.D.)--Newspapers.", "North Dakota--Cass County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01234907", "North Dakota--Fargo.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01211331"], "city": ["Fargo"], "date": "19080804", "title": "The Fargo forum and daily republican.

Most of this double-tracking\nf- -ftow is completed. PrOm Fort Wll\nflam and Port Arthur, the twin cities\nThunder bay, most of the grain is\n.t- fcured out of the \"bottle\" to go for\nward in boats through Lake Superior.\nBecause the bulk of the grain centers\nttpon th#se ports the Canadian North\nern has built at Port Arthur the\ntreatest grain elevator In the world,\n6he of a capacity of 7,000,000 bushels.\nThe first hint of Canada's new in\ntentions was given in a speech by an\ndfflcer of the Canadian* Northern at\n#tidbury when the line was completed\nifd\nthat point early this month The\npeech was not reported at the time,\nut since then it has been brought to\nhe attention of railroad men in this\n#lty, who consider it of great sig\nnificance.\nI The speaker began his remarks by\nSaying that ther had now proceeded\niVtore than one-third of the distance on\nP*. their march to connect Port Arthur\nWith the eastern lines of the Canadian\nNorthern syftem, and that they would\n\u2022oon be running into Port Arthur ovftr\ntheir own rails or over borrowed rails,\nttns giving to western Canada a new\niutlet for her wheat. He then took\nto warn Canadians generally\nhat year by year the west was be\naming more important to the east\nWtan the east to the west, and said\nAdditional rails alone could prevent\nthe natural community of interest of\nj^\u00bbe western provinces and the western\n\u2022Utes from breaking up Canadian\nRational unity. \"James J.

As a compensation for\nour action with respect to free com\nmodities. which is of great benefit to\nher, Canada has made substantial\nreductions in duties on American\ncommodities which represent a sub\nstantially larger value of trade than\nIs represented by the Canadian com\nmodities on which we have reduced\nduties under the agreement, although\nthe reductions made by the United\nStates cover a large proportion of the\ndutiable imports from Canada. * * *\nDuties and other charges will be\nlowered on products of which we ship\nped to Canada, in the fiscal year\n\u2022ending March, 1930, about $415,\n000,000. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOn the other hand, the concessions\nmade to Canada by the United States\nin the agreement are also of wide\nreaching character. They affect com\nmodities which accounted for about\ntwo-thirds of our total imports from\nCanada in 1929. \u2666 \u2022 *\nImports from Canada into the\nUnited States dropped from *503,000.\n000 in 1929 to $232,000,000 in 1934. or\nby 54 per cent. Exports from the\nUnited States to Canada dropped from\n$899,000,000 in 1929 (not including\ngrain in transit for Europe), to $302,\n000 In 1934. a decrease of 66 per\ncent. * * *\nCanadian Concessions.\nThe Canadian concessions to the\nUnited States fall into four general\ngroups:\n<1). Direct duty reductions on items\nnamed, commodity by commodity, in\nwhat is known as schedule 1 of the\nagreement.\n12). The grant to the United States\non all other commodities of the low\nest rates now or hereafter paid by\nany non-British country (these are\nrommonly referred to as \"most favored\nforeign nation\u201d rates) in place of the\nhigher \"general'\u2019 rates,\n(3.) A large and satisfactory mea\nsure of relief with respect to the\nCanadian system of arbitrary valua\ntions heretofore applied on many\ncommodities.\n< 4.) Benefits to commercial travel\ners and to transmit trade passing\nthrough the United States resulting\nfrom general provisions of the agree\nment, together with promised legis\nlation regarding exemption of tourist\npurchases from duty. * * *\nThose duty reductions on the part\nof Canada which are specified by\nname in schedule 1, together with a\nfew items on which the existing rates\nare bound against increase, number\nabout 180. The commodities covered\naccounted for $175,000,000 out of the\ntotal of $523,000,000 of dutiable im\nports into Canada from the United\nStates In the fiscal year 1929-30. \u2022 \u2022 *\nRates at Lowest.\nIn the case of 80 or more duty\nreductions specified in schedule 1,\nhowever, representing a value of trade\nin the base year 1929-30 of over $115,\n000.000, the rates named are lower\nthan those heretofore paid by any\nnon-British country. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOf almost equally great advantage to\nAmerican agriculture and industry is\nthe fact that under the trade agree\nment all commodities which we sell to\nCanada, including hundreds of items\nnot listed in schedule 1, will hereafter\npay no rate of duty higher than the\nlowest rate, whether now in effect or\nhereafter established, on the goods of\nany other country outside of the\nBritish Empire.\nThis means that hereafter American\ngoods receive the benefit (a) of all\nthe \u2018'intermediate\u201d rates of the\nCanadian tariff; (b) of the still lower\nrates fixed on many items by Can\nada's existing trade agreements with\nother non-British countries, notably\nwith France; and (c) of any lower\nrates hereafter fixed by trade agree\nments of Canada with any non-British\ncountry. Although, unlike the items\nIn schedule 1, the duty reductions on\nthese items are not bound as to dura\ntion, they become effective immedi\nately when the agreement enters into\nforce. * * *\nListed in Separate Table.\nAll the export products of the\nUnited States affected by these Ca\nnadian concessions are listed in a\nseparate table, which shows for each\nthe old and the new rates, the per\ncentage of duty reduction and the\nvalue of Canadian imports from the\nUnited States during the fiscal years\n1929-1930 and 1934-1935.

S. Business.\nA point of great significance in con\nnection with Canada's grant to us of\nher intermediate and treaty rates is\nthe fact that this means much more\nthan mere removal of differentials\nheretofore existing against us as\ncompared with non-British countries.\nIt does, of course, mean this is in the\ncase of the commodities where non\nBritish countries are important com\npetitors of the United States in the\nCanadian market. The removal of the\nformer duty differentials against us\nwill enable American exporters to\nobtain a larger share of the trade in\nsuch commodities. Most of the ar\nticles of this group, however, are not\nof major importance in our trade\nwith Canada.\nOn the other hand, in the case of\nmany other important commodities,\nour competition in Canadian markets\nis chiefly with the United Kingdom\nand other parts of the British Em\npire. \u2022 \u00bb \u2022\nChanges in Valuation.\nChanges in duty valuation system:\nA broad advantage to many lines of\nAmerican exports will result from\nchanges in Canada\u2019s system of valu\ning commodities for duties. These\nchanges are assured either by trade\nagreement itself or by a note of the\nCanadian government accompanying\nit. There has been gradually growing\nin Canada a system, taking several\ndistinct forms, of applying arbitrary\nassessments exceeding the invoice\nvalues of Imported goods. The re\nsulting charges were materially\nhigher, in some instances several\nlimes higher, than the nominal duty\nrates. On some commodities the\npractice meant not merely that the\nad valorem rates were applied on a\nhigher sum, but that the difference\nbetween the, arbitrary value and the\ninvoice value had to be paid as a\nso-called dumping duty.\nThese methods of valuing commod\nities have caused much complaint on\ni\nthe part of American producers and j\nexporters, by reason both of the\nheight of the resulting charges and\nof their uncertainty. They have af\nfected a large number of our com\nmodities, including not only fresh;\nfruits and vegetables and various\nother farm products, but also a wide\nrange of manufactured goods such as\nautomobiles, radio receiving sets, elec\ntrical apparatus, flooring and textiles.\nCustoms Act Change Seen.\nThe Canadian note contains definite\nundertakings that the government will\nsponsor legislation amending the three\nsections of the customs act which have\nbeen particularly onerous in such\nmanner as to afford a very large\nmeasure of relief. The note assures\nfurther that pending such legislation\nremedial changes in the regulations\nas to customs administration will be\nmade immediately, so far as existing\nlaw will permit. \u00bb \u2022 *\nGeneral provisions benefiting Amer\nican trade:\nIn addition to the duty reductions\nprovided in the agreement, several im\nportant advantages for American trade\nhave been secured. Thus, as a result\nof the most favored nation status,\nwhich we hereafter enjoy, American\ncommercial travelers will have the\nprivilege of bringing in their samples\nJ\n\u2022\nunder bond instead of having to pay\nfull duty without refund. Again, the\nproducts of any non-empire country\nshipped to Canada in transit through\nAmerican ports will hereafter receive\nas favorable treatment by the Cana\ndian customs as if they had come di\nrectly over. The Canadian government\nhas given assurance in a note that it\nwill sponsor legislation in Parliament\nto permit residents of Canada visiting\nthe United States to bring back with\nthem free of duty articles for their\npersonal use up to a value of $100,\na privilege similar to that now enjoyed\nby Americans returning from visits to\nCanada or other countries.\nU. S. Concessions to Canada.\nThe concessions granted by the\nUnited States in exchange for the ad\nvantages thus secured from Canada\nfor our agriculture and industry may\nbe briefly summarized as follows:\n1. The binding of the existing free\nentry into this country of pulpwood,\nwood pulp and newsprint paper; un\nmanufactured wood generally; certain\nkinds of simply manufactured wood\nsuch as shingles and lathe; certain\nfishery products including lobsters;\ncertain kinds of furs: crude asbestos,\ncrude artificial abrasives, certain fer\ntilizers. and & number of less important\ncommodities. All of this means no\na\nJ change In the existing free list.\n2. Reductions in duty, but for speci\nfied quantities on cattle, calves, dairy\ncows, cream, certified seed potatoes\nand lumber and timber of Douglas fir\nor Western hemlock: any imports in\nexcess of the specified quantities will\npay tne old rates.\n3. Reductions in duty on ltfmber\nand timber of other species; on Ched\nI dar cheese, turnips, apples, hay. maple\nI sugar, live poultry and horses, on\nhalibut and certain minor kinds of\nfish, and on patent leather, harness\nleather, ferromanganese, ferrosilicon,\nacetic acid and several other minor\nitems.\n4. The binding against increase of\nthe existing 10 per cent duty on cer\ntain feedstuffs for animals. Here\nagain no change in our present tariff\nis made.\nClause on Restriction*.\nThe United States, as in the case\nof its trade agreements with other\ncountries, agrees that on all com\nmodities Canada sells to this country\nshe will receive the treatment ac\ncorded to the most-favored nation,\nexcept of course that accorded to our\nterritories and possessions and to\nCuba. \u2022 * *\nWood Pulp Provisions.\nThe agreement recently made with\nA\n\\\nSweden bound on the free list certain\nmajor classes of wood pulp, of which\nCanada is also an important supplier,\nhaving furnished us such pulp to a\nvalue of $16,485,000 in 1920. Canada,\nof course, obtains the benefit of the\nobligation given to Sweden. The\nCanadian trade agreement itself pro\nvides for binding on the free list other\nclasses of wood pulp and a number\nof other articles of great importance.\nThe articles thus bound accounted in\n1929 for about $221,000,000 worth of\nimports from Canada, or 44 per cent\nof our total purchases from that\ncountry.\nTotal imports from Canada in 1929\nof those dutiable articles of which\nCanada is our principal foreign sup\nplier were valued at about $135,000.\n000. The trade agreement reduces the\nduties on commodities valued In the\ntrade of that year at about $79,000,000\nor somewhat less than 60 per cent of\nthis total. These duty reductions apply\nto commodities representing about 16\nper cent of our total imports from\nCanada in 1929. \u2022 \u2022 *\nReciprocal Concessions.\nReciprocal concessions on agricul\ntural products:\nIn the negotiation of this agree\nment our Government has recognized\nthat a substantial balance should be\n$\nmaintained between the concessions\ngranted by this country on agricul\ntural products and those obtained\nfrom Canada on agricultural products.\nEven if the United States had ob\ntained from Canada little in the wav\nof duty reductions on farm products,\nour farmers would have gained much *\nfrom the numerous and important\nconcessions obtained for American\n; manufactured goods. The Increase in\nj the exports of our lactories, which\nseems bound to result, will so add to\nthe purchasing power of the wage\nearners that they can buy more of\nthe products of American farms.\nMoreover, our farmers, as large con\nsumers of Canadian products on which\nour own duties have been reduced, will\nbe protected against unduly high >\nprices for those commodities.\nAs a matter of fact, however, the\nagreement does much more than this\nfor our agriculture. It will assure\nlarge increases in exports of American\nfarm products to Canada. There is\ngood reason to anticipate that these\nincreases will at least equal the in\ncreases in imports of agricultural com\nmodities from Canada resulting from\nthe concessions which we have made\nto her. Moreover, in making duty\nreductions the Government has taken\nthe greatest care to prevent injury to\nany group of American farmers. * \u2022 *\nThe most important one concession\nmade by Canada in the field of agri\nculture is that relating to the Cana\ndian tariff paragraph which covers\nfresh vegetables. Canada has lope\ndistinguished between the season when\nher farmers are marketing their output\nof such vegetables, and the \"off sea\nson.\" when there has been a basic ad\nvalorem rate. 30 per cent since 1930\napplicable throughout the year, but\nduring the competitive season this has 1\nj been supplemented, as regards most\n; kinds of vegetables, both by minimum\nspecific rates in cents per pound and\n| by so-called valuation advances. Under\n, this valuation method not only did\ni the ad valorem rate apply to a value\n| higher than the invoice value, but the\nj difference between the two values was\nj charged as a \"dumping\u201d duty. \u2022 \u2022 \u00ab\nI The agreement makes great changes\nin the charges pavable on this im\nportant group of fresh vegetables. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nEffect of Concessions.\nThe effect of the concessions on the\nj charges applicable to those American\nvegetables which still remain subject\nj to valuation advances may best be\nI shown by an illustration. Formerly \u2022\n: if the invoice value of a given vege\n| table were 5 cents per pound, and if\nthe valuation advance applicable were\n3 cents per pound, the charge would\n| have been 20 per cent on 8 cents, plus\na dumping duty of 3 cents, making\na total of 5 4 cents per pound. Here\nafter the valuation advance, if applied\nat all. may net exceed 2 4 cents per\n; pound (four-fifths of the former 3\n' cents), and the duty in that case will\nbe 15 per cent of 7.4 cents tnamely\n1 1 cents) plus 2 4 cents, or a total\nof 3 5 cents per pound, as against\nthe former total of 5 4 cents, a charg?\n35 per cent less than before. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA similar adjustment respecting\nad valorem duties, specific minimum\nrates, and valuation advances has\nbeen made in those Canadian tariff\nparagraphs which cover all except\ncitrus fruits. Here the basic ad va\nlorem rate has been reduced from 20\nto 15 per cent, the valuation advances\n! have been canceled on several classes,\n| and such advances as may hereafter\nbe applied on other kinds of fruit will\nbe at least one-fifth lower than here\ntofore. * * *\nImportant for Farmers.\nThe statistics of Canada's imports\nfrom the United States in 1929-30\nbefore the increase in her duties and\nin her system of valuation advances,\nindicate the great importance of the\nconcessions obtained for our farmers\nby the trade agreement. The total\nvalue of imports of agricultural prod\nucts from the United States in that\nyear was about $134,000,000. This in\ncludes. however, a large value of free\nimports (cotton alone amounting to\nover $27,000,000), and also some duti\nable articles where the United States\nwas not the principal source of im\nports. The imports of articles dutiable\nunder present laws, of which the\nUnited States was the principal sup\nplier. are only about half of this $134\n000.000. Reductions in duty in one\nform or another have been secured on\narticles accounting for about $53,000.\n000 of this total. The charges on most\nof these commodities which we ship to\nCanada will be at least one-third lower\nthan heretofore, and in some cases the\nreduction will range from 50 to 100\nper cent. * * *\nAgricultural Concessions.\nIn return for the benefits thus se\ncured for our farmers, the United\nStates has made concessions of im\nportance to Canada's agricultural\ncommunity. Our total imports of\nfarm products from Canada in 1929\namounted to about $45,000,000. nearly\nall dutiable. Of this total about $8 -\n400.000 consisted of certain animal\nfeedstuffs. and the agreement binds\nagainst increasing our present 10 per\ncent duty on these. On commodities\nof which the imports from Canada in\n1929 amounted to about $25,000,000,\nthe duties have been reduced. This\ntotal includes cattle, calves, dairy cows,\ncream and certified seed potatoes. On\nthese the new lower rates apply only\nto specified quantities, any larger im\nports continuing to pay the old duties.\nThese five items accounted for only\nS17.000.000 in our imports from Can\nada in 1929. * * *\nMaple Sugar Duty Cut.\nAmerican duties have also been re\nduced on maple sugar, turnips and\nfrozen blueberries. Imports of these\ncommodities supplement our inade\nquate domestic production.\nA concession is made by the United\nStates on cattle, calves and dairy cows.\nBut the duty reduction on cattle re\nlates only to those weighing 700 pounds\nor more each, the imports of which\ncome almost entirely from Canada.\nThe rate is reduced from 3 to 2 cents\nper pound, but is at the same time\nspecifically provided chat entries (from\nall countries and not merely from\nCanada), at this lower rate may not\nexceed in any year three-fourths of\n1 per cent of our average annual total\ndomestic slaughter of cattle and calves\nfrom 1928 to 1932.\nThe lowered duty on calves (l'i\ncents against the former 2'- cents per\npound) Is similarly specifically lim\nited to a small percentage of domestic\nproduction, and that on dairy cows\n(also l'.i cent*) is specifically limited\nto 20,000 head, which is a small frac\ntion of 1 per cent of the number of\ncows annually reaching the milk pro\nducing age in the United States. It\nis self-evident that the imports of\ncattle, calves and dairy cows at the\nreduced rate, within the limits thus\nspecified, cannot appreciably affect\nthe prices received by our farmers.\nIt may be noted, in this connection,\nthat the reduced duty on cattle will\nbenefit many American farmers who\nfatten purchased feeders for sale,\nsince a large proportion of the small\n(Continued on Ninth Page.)\nA", "batch": "dlc_1guston_ver01", "title_normal": "evening star.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1935-11-18/ed-1/seq-8.json", "place": ["District of Columbia--Washington"], "page": "A-8"}, {"sequence": 7, "county": ["Vance"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily (except Sunday)", "id": "/lccn/sn91068401/1940-08-27/ed-1/seq-7/", "subject": ["Henderson (N.C.)--Newspapers.", "North Carolina--Henderson.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01220049", "North Carolina--Vance County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01210548", "Vance County (N.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Henderson"], "date": "19400827", "title": "Henderson daily dispatch.", "end_year": 1995, "note": ["Archived issues are available in digital format from the Library of Congress Chronicling America online collection.", "Description based on: 3rd yr., no. 15 (Aug. 29, 1916).", "Issue for Mar. 8, 1932 called: All-Women's Work Edition.", "Vols. for Aug. 14, 1930- dropped vol. numbering."], "state": ["North Carolina"], "section_label": "", "type": "page", "place_of_publication": "Henderson, N.C.", "start_year": 1914, "edition_label": "", "publisher": "Henderson Dispatch Co.", "language": ["English"], "alt_title": ["Henderson, N.C. daily dispatch"], "lccn": "sn91068401", "country": "North Carolina", "ocr_eng": "i,i Canada's Key# Defense Posts\n,v men have been named to key posts in Canada's defense\n:'u Col.

With the great flood of\nimmigration that has been going into\nCanada for the past several years\nfrom many foreign countries and\nalso from the United States, it was\nnot realized that such a large num\nber of people were leaving Canada,\nthe vast majority of them being\nthose who were going back to their\nformer homes.\nI'lt'iniei- Makes Statement.\nAs far back at May 1, 1911. the\nHon. R. L. Borden, premier of Can\nada, told the House of Commons\nthat Canada was losing her citizens.\n'\u2022It is a rather astonshing fact,\"\nsaid Mr. Borden, \"to find that in a\nsingle year not less than 94,496 per\nsons have left Canada for perma\nnent homes in the United States.''\nContinuing further, he said, \"1 have\nnow the report of the. commissioner\ngeneral of immigration for the Unit\ned States which gives the returns tip\nto June 30, 19in. According to\nthese returns the immigration from\nthe United States to Canada during\nthe twelve months amounted to 116,\n37 7. The report classifies that im\nmigration as follows: United States\ncitizens, 7S,697 Canadian citizens,\n15,203 other aliens, 22,477, making\na total of 116,3 7 7.\n\"During the same period the im\nmigration from Canada to the Unit\ned States, according to this report,\nwas as follows: United States citi\nzens, 22,832 Canadian citizens, 44,\n328 other aliens. 27,336, making a\ntotal of 94,496. If these statistics\nare correct,\" continued Mr. Borden,\n\"the balance of immigration into\nCanada from the United States over\nthe immigration from Canada in the\nUnited States was a little less than\n22,000, which result 1 am bound to\nsay is one that 1 would hardly have\nexpected.\"\nImmigration to States (iron's.\nThe reports of the United States\ncommissioner at Montreal show that\nthe immigration from Canada to the\nUnited States has materially increas\ned since Mr. Borden brought this\nmatter to the attention of his gov\nernment. The United States immi\ngration commissioner's report shows\nthat while 94,4 96 persons left Can\nada to live in the United States in\nthe year ending June 30, 1910, the\nnumber in the next twelve months\nwas 105,512 and in the last fiscal\nyear it was 143,57 8. immigration\nfrom the United States to Canada in\nthe last three years has also un\ncreased. The number of residents\ngoing from this country to Canada\nin these three years have been 119,\n753, 143,251 and 139,009, respec\ntively.\nThere was widespread disappoint\nment in Canada when the results of\nthe 1911 census were made known.\nThe population of the Dominion, as\nshown by that cens.us, was more than\nhalf a million less than had been es\ntimated. The population of Canada\nin 1901, according to the government\ncensus, was 5,371.415. In the per\niod from 1901 to 1911 the immigra\ntion into Canada, according to gov\nernment statistics, was 1,845,679. It\nis estimated that the natural in\ncrease of citizens in that time, that\nis the excess in the number of births\nover deaths, would be 650.000, which\nshould have given to Canada in 191 1\na population of 7,866.994. or close\nto the 8,000,000 mark. Instead of\nthat, however, the 1911 government\ncensus showed the population to be\n7,204,83S, which is 662.156 less\nthan the immigration figures and\nnatural increase estimate, together\nwith the number of people there in\n1901 would show. This falling off in\nthe 1911 showing as anticipated by\nthe Canadian people is due to the\nimmigration into the United States.\nPrairie Provinces Lose Most.\nA large per cent of the citizens of\nthe United States who have returned\nto this country after having settled\nin Canada came from the western\nprovinces, as is shown by the state\nment of the United States immigra\ntion commissioner, John H. Clarke\nof Montreal. From a report kept by\nCommissioner Clarke, beginning\nwith 1910. it is shown that our peo\nple are coming back in ever increas\ning numbers. Mr. Clarke's state\nment follows:\n\"Previous to our fiscal year end\ned June 30, 1910, no record was kept\nof United States citizcns returning\nafter a residence in Canada, but since\nthat time a record has been kept\nmerely of the total of such passen\ngers, no attempt being made to se\ncure any detailed information con\ncerning the length of their residence\nin Canada or the province ,n which\nthe/ had resided.\n\"The regulations of our depart\nment now require that when passen\ngers found to be United States citi\nzens are encountered, tliey are to be\nquestioned as to their former resi\ndence and intended future residence,\nand if it is found that they have\nbeen residents of Canada and are e\nturning again to take up their resi\ndence in the United States, this fact\nis noted and a report made merely\nof the number of such passengers.\n\"The following are the total of\nsuch passengers recorded during\neach of our last, lour liscal years.\nFiscal year ending June 30:\n1 9 22.832\n1911 3 1,432\n.912 3S.3 17\n1 91 3 5 4.4 97\nI might add ti.at the report., from\nour border ports where these passeti\nIgers were recorded would indicate\n)that an overwhelming majority came\nIfrom the provinces west of Lake Su\nperior.\"\nCanada Becoming Aroused.\nThe Canadian people have said\n-very little about this.

When Mr.\nBorden made the statement referred\nto in the first part of this article,\nCanadian reciprocity was occupying\nthe attention of the people of Canada\nand of the United States and but\nlittle notice was paid to his warning.\nHe was severely criticised, however,\nfor making such a statement, and\nnewspapers which have printed the\nfacts have been accused of disloyal\nty to Canada. The steady increasing\nnumbers of people from the United\nStates, however, who are giving up\ntheir short time residence in Canada\nand returning to their own country\nhas arouse some of the newspapers\nand public men who feel that it is a\nmistake to ignore this condition, but\nrather that it should be studied and\nits reason sought for.\nIn an editorial headed \"Canada\nLosing Citizens,\" the Grain Growers'\nGuide, a farm paper published at\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, among other\ncomments says: \"That there should\nbe a large immigration to Canada\nfrom the United States is only natur\nal. Canada is a comparatively new\ncountry, rich in natural resources,\nwith fertile soil and immense areas\nof undeveloped land, and while the\nsettlers are coming from Europe\nby hundred of thousands every year,\nit would be surprising indeed if the\nenterprising people of the republic\nlying alongside our southern border\ndid not join in the invasion.\n\"It is not surprising, therefore, to\nfind a large immigration from the\nUnited States to Canada, and while\nthe United State authorities are ex\nerting themselves to keep their peo\nple at home, they recognize neverthe\nless that the movement from the Amer\nican northwest to Canada is only a\ncontinuation of the movement of\npopulation from the older settled\nportions of the United States to Min\nnesota. the Dakotas and other north\nwestern states.\nMoving I'rom .New Country to H(1.\n\"A large movement from Canada\nto the states, however, is a totally\ndifferent thing. It is not natural\nand we doubt if any precedent can be\nfound for such a condition. That\nthere should be a large migration\nfrom a new country richly endowed\nnature, a country possessing wide\nareas of fertile virgin soil and which\nproves its agricultural capabilities\nanew at every international exposi\ntion, to an older, more settled coun\ntry with less natural resources and\nadvantages and where the best, op\nportunities are already taken up.\nThe United States immigration\nauthorities declare that 1 43,57 8 per\nsons, residents of Canada, left this\ncountry to settle permanently in the\nUnited States in the year ending\nJune 30th, last. If that be untrue it\nis the duty of the Canadian govern\nment to make a denial and furnish\nthe most complete proof. If it is\ntrue, then a most serious condition\nis disclosed. If there is a large mi\ngration of Canadians, European im\nmigrants and former Americans from\nCanada to the states, we should\nknow why they are discontented\nwith their Canadian homes. Canada\nis all right, the best country under\nthe sun. But economics and indus\u00ad|\ntrial conditions brought about by\n^rasping interests which have influ\nenced legislation and secured for\nthemselves special privileges to ex\noit the people are not all right.

She\njbas cost us nothing in the way of\npreparation for defense against her\npossible assault, and she never will.\nShe has sought to agree with us\nquickly when differences have dis\nturbed our relations. She shares with\nns common traditions and aspirations,\nfeel I have correctly interpreted the\nish of 'the American people by ex\npressing In the arrangements now\nanbmltted to congress for Its approval\ntheir desire for a more intimate and\neordlal relationship with Canada\ntherefore earnestly hope that the\n^measure will be promptly enacted in\nto law.\"-\nThe principle purpose of a recipro\ncal trade agreement with Canada, re\njoaoVing the duty on farm products\nrooming from that country, is the hope\nand expectation that food stuffs will\nbe cheapened and the cost of living\nReduced. The high cost of living and\nthe demand for reciprocity with Can\nada was the principal political issue\nIn New England and our eastern\nstates In the last congressional elec\ntion, and this Issue was mainly the\ncause of republloaii defeat and demo\ncratic suocess at ihe polls last Novem\nber.\nA careful examination of our trade\nxalatlaas with Oanadft clearly demon'\nstrates that the people of the'east\nwho voted the democratic ticket, hop\ning thereby to seoure free trade in\nCanadian farm products and thus re\nduce the oost of living, were deceived\nby politicians andst range ly\nformed regarding the probability of\nany reduction In the coat of living by\nadmitting Canadian food products\nfree of dut/. The detailed statistics\nof exports from tbe United States to\nCanada for IBJLO proves the absurdity\nof tbe claim that bread and meat are\n\u00abtasa0er In Canada than in the United\n\u2022tales. Let us examine the quantity\nand things we aold tfc Canada last\nfear, beginning with whstls classed\naa biead atalb.\nCAKADA ntPDRTS FOODS.\nThe rtcord of our department of\neomsMroe shows we shipped Into Can\nada In 1910 broad stuffs consisting of\neon, saetl oats, rye, wheat, wheat\nfloor, preparations for table food\n\u20227,280,701 worth. The Canadian con\namaar had also to pay freight charges\non all ttisss things and a duty to the\nlam govsimment on very many of\ntbeee Importations. Sorely the Ca\nnadian oonsamer would not come to\ntbe United States and boy 17,000,000\nworth of bread stuflh if such things\nam cheaper\nj& hoaia. In/eturn we\nporohased from Canada bread stuffs\nvalued at tl,149^86.\nHut and dairy ppduete have ruled\njfecy high in the United Statea in ie\nasntyftan, and an always mentioned\n^\"'aHhen nwnMaaing .'the things that\n?*i rinfmii\u2014&1\" ttp* ofilvtnff.\naaflghboca would hardly\n\"anaa'ta UM .'Asttrioan\npatk anddaity\nftiNpt'iMn\nm-V'^V\nte'\nheavy Canadian duty. Does this In\ndicate that breakfast bacon and ham\nand lard are oheaper in Canada than\nin Chicago and Boston? Why did the\npeople of Montreal and Winnipeg and\nVancouver buy such quantities of\nmeat from the United States? If such\nfood stuffs were cheaper in Canada\nthan in Illinois, New York or Massa\nchusettes where uninformed voters at\nthe late election were told by dema\ngogue politicians that reciprocity In\nCanadaln food products would reduce\nthe cost of living if Insurgent Foss\nhad' told his factory working constit\nuents that our rural Canadian friends\nthat were reported so anxious to sell\nus cheap meat and dairy products\nactually came into tbe American mar\nket and bought over 94,000,000 worth\nof our high priced meat\u2014and that we\nwith our 90,000,000 consumers only\nbought in the same time $304,817\nworth of meat and dairy products\nfrom tbe Canadian packers and farm\ners\u2014this fact would have been an eye\nopener and a mouth closer for Mr\nFoss and his followers.\nWHAT CANADA BOUGHT OK US\nCanada also bought from the Amer\nlean farmer and ranchman last year\n$4,197,462 worth of live animals, pay\ning their home government a custom\nduty on the same, while we bought\nfrom Canada, $1,746,238. Does this\nindicate that horses, cattle and sheep\nare cheaper in Canada than in Dakota\nor Texas? We also sold our British\nfriends to tbe north of us $5,013,286\nworth of fruit, green and preserved\nand over a million dollars worth of\nvegetables, canned and pickled, on\nwhich the Canadian consumer had to\npay a heavy duty to his own govern\nment, while our purchase of fruits\nand vegetables combined was only\n$1,019,927.\nThese figures are taken from the\nbureau of trade relations, department\nof state, for the fiscal year 1910. The\nfigures for last year are in no way ex\nceptional as to quantities of values.\nOur total trade with Canada on pure\nly farm products for 1910 was, sold to\nCanada, $35,623,635 bought from Can\nada, $15,951,882.\nThe farmers In our corn states\nshould hesitate before condemning\nthe proposed reciprocity \"agreement\nwith Canada. Of course a law that\nwould admit American farm products\ninto Canada free of duty and keep a\nprohibitive duty on Canadian farm\nproducts seeking a market in the\nUnited States, would look good to the\ninsurgent farmers of Kansas and\nIowa, but it would be a poor brand of\nreciprocity which our good Canadian\nneighbors would hardly be willing to\naccept.\nOar trade with the Dominion of\nCanada demonstrates that tbe cost of\nliving cannot be materially reduced\nby removing the duties on farm pro\nducts, for In 24 hours after this con\ntem plated reciprocity treaty becomes\nlaw farm products in Canada will\nsell at exactly the' American price,\nthe producer and consumer getting\nthe benefit of shortest hauls and low\nest freight rates. It Is poor economy\nfor the American or Canadian \"eon\nsumer to ship hay or coal or any\nheavy commodity a thousand miles\nwhen tbe saihe can be obtained with\nin a hundred miles of where it is\nwanted a abort haul and less freight\nto consumers on both sides of tbe\nline will also help the producer.\nAmericans will buy Canadian coal\nhay and flour some places, and Cana\ndians! will buy American coal, fiour\nand fruits at other places, the freight\nor cost of getting It to tbe consumer\ngoverning In both cases. American\nfarmers need have no fear of fair\ntrade with Canada. Wheat\n1\nly\n$h\n(Is\nUNTA-F^?4 CANADATWICK WHAT WB BUY\nher\nonly surplus food product and if the\nCanadian wheat farmer can reach\ntide water, at the same freight rate\nas the American wheat farmer, Cana\ndian wheat will command the same\nprice on tbe farm as the American\nwheat of alike quality, as tbe surplus\nwheat of both countries is sold in tbe\nsame market/\nThe things which Canada Is partic\nularly long on are land and lumber.\nCbeap and abundant and both anx\niously seeking American purchasers.\nLast year we sold to Canada all told\n\u2022223,501,800 and bought from Canada\n\u2022104,199,674 viz. we sold her twice as\nmuch as we bought Of the things\nwe purchased lumber and forest pro\nducts are by far the largest items,\namounting to $33,113,450, or t*Ice as\nmuch in value as all tbe farm pro\nduets imported from Canada in the\nsame time, and Is practically one'\nthird of all our purchases from the\nDominion of Canada. If this country\nwas annually Importing 933,000,000\nworth of farm products from Canada\nour farmers would have justification\nin protesting against congress con\nfirming a trade agreement that re\nmoved all tariff protection against a\ncompetitor that under present condi\ntions was able to invade their own\nmarket and undersell them. The\nAmerican lumber industry in reoent\nyears has been the target for e.very\nnear statesman, pralre politician pol\nitician, uninformed ^magazine writer\non industrial subnets\u2014and almost\nevery daily newspaper in the country\nbaa been proclaiming against tbe in\niquitous lumber trust, without any\nfacta to justify their statements.\nEven President Taft, influenced by\niperand popular ignoranee,\ntelle oontffasae In hie message reoom\nthe paeaege of this trade\nwith Canada, that ''free\nmust have.\" \"By giving\nourpeopte access to Canadian foreats\nvatfttU nduee tbe consumption of\ne\u00abt o\u00abn, wbleh in the hands of com\nflew beam\nM\u00bb\nhave a\nlenuiiSB the enlamaihsnt\narnlluWa UaM rannioii\nmm* trow\nif-1 rYr ip\nprairie states. The lumber resources\nof this country are not in the hands\nof comparatively few owners. It may\nhave some foundation when applied\nto white pine, which represents but a\nvery small fraction of our forest re\nsources.\nAS TO THB LUMBEK SITUATION.\nOur last national census reports 48,\n000 saw mills in the United States be\nsides other thousands of timber own\ners, and lumber, excepting the better\ngrades of white pine, is not high in\nprice. The average prices of yellow\npine (which now constitutes one-third\nof all lumber manufactured in thin\ncountry) averaged less than $13.50 per\n1,000 feet at the mills where it was\nproduced and the claim that admit'\nting cheap free Canadian lumber Into\nthe United States would conserve our\nforests Is an error of the uninformed\nlacking the knowledge of practical\nlogging operations. Gifford Pinchot\nIs surely good authority on this sub\nject and a very hero in insurgency\nthe leader and king of conservation\nists, and he says that reducing the\ntariff on lumber \"widens the area of\ncheap stumpage and Increases the\nwaste of our own.\"\nThe kind of lumber shipped by Can\nada to this country Is mainly Norway\nspruce, Br and the low grades of white\npine, carried by water to our lake\ncities at a freight rate so low that\nyellow pine suitable to take its place\ncannot compete and billions of infer\nior logs available to make useful tlm\nber are now left rotting in our south\nera woods because the product made\nfrom them cannot compete in our\nnorthern markets with the untaxed\ncheap stumpage and low, water\nfreighted lumber from Canada.\nIt Is true that Canada buys some\nlumber from us, but it is of a kind\nthat does not grow in her own terri\ntory. She bought all told from us\nlast year $7,873,864 worth of lumber\nand forest products, mostly hard\nwoods and pitch pine, which do not\ngrow in their country and were re\nquired for special purposes. Among\nthe lumber items we exported to\nCanada was 50,000,000 feet of oak lum\nber to be manufactured into furniture\nand things for which it is suitable\nand the things for which it is suitable\nand desired.\nTHB UNITED STALES HAS THE AD\nVANTAGE.\nIn trade relations with our north\nern neigbors the United States Is far\nmore Independent than Canada. We\nproduce in abundance everything\nthat Canada can grow and sell us.\nwhile Canada by reason of her more\nnorthern latitude must come to us for\nmany things which cannot possibly be\ngrown in her territory, such as corn\ncotton, tobacco and many semitropi\ncal fruits and vegetables.\nThe only Industries in this country\nthat will be injured by Canadian rec\niprocity as formulated by our depart\nment of state and the Canadian gov\nernment are the lumber Industry,\nand to a lesser extent the American\nrailroads, for every foot of Canadian\nlumber shipped to tbls country by\nwater is a loss in freight revenue of\n$6 per 1,000 feet, as this is approxl\nmately what the rail freight would be\nfor carrying American .lumber from\nthe southern mills to the lake cities\nreceiving Canadian lumber by water\nLUMBER BUSINESS WILL BE DEPRESSED\nConservation of our forest resources\nwill be discouraged and the waste of\nlow grade logs will be increased. Tbe\nlumber industry will be further d&\npressed by increased comhetition the\nrailroads will have less lumber to\nhaul, and shorter hauls on\u201e many\nother things, as nearness from pro\nducer to consumer will govern our\nsales and purchases. This feature\nmay be considered an economic gain,\nand while hurtful to some is perhaps\nthe strongest claim in favor of free\ntrade with Canada. I predict reci\nprocity on farm products will not af\nfeet the purpose for which it was in\ntended, viz., reduce the cost of living.\nReducing the duty on eggs ana but\nter will not Increase the stock on\nhand. Food stuffs are not going to de\ncline in price until its production in\ncreases. Our trade with Canada for tbe\npast five years shows we have export\ned to that country twice as much\nfarm products as we bought from\nthere. The* treaty will help some\nCanadian farmers living close to our\neastern centers of population, who\nwill now pocket the revenue wblch\nour custom houses heretofore collect\ned _and our American farmers will be\nable to sell bis Canadian neighbors\nmore live animals, hay, pork, lard,\nfruit, vegetables and cotton seed oil\nwithout having any Canadian custom\nhouse barriers tp overcome, and the\nlost national revenue will have to\ncome from some other source.\nSKNATOR^CUKMINS SHOULD EXPLAIN.\nI see Senator Cummins while fav\noring reciprocity with Canada, is not\naltogether satisfied with the terms or\nMr. Taft's agreement and thinks it\nabsurd to retain a 4 per cent, duty on\nCanadian lumber, dressed and matched\nready for use, or a duty of 50 cents\nper barrel on Canadian flour, while\npotting Canadian meat on the free\nlist. Reformers are apt to find fault\nwith anyene who interferes with\ntheir patented ideas. Mr. Cummins\nshould explain. Does he want Amer\nican people to eat Canadian flour\nmade from Canadian wheat, and ship\nour own wheat in the rough to\nEurope? That would be absurd sure\nly, for the whole policy of protection\nis to tax manufactured things afed let\nin raw materials it a lower tax.\nHowever, absurd ideas and\nmenu are sometimes useful In at\ntracting attention. Silence may be\ngolden but is not bankable and ie\nquiree no space In tbe Congreaslonal\nBeeoid. Senator Sumner, laaraad\naad brilliant,\nindependent grandstander, rarely\nagreeing with bis party administra\ntion, while an honest, pious man, was\nsuspected of disbelieving the bible\nand some of his near friends admitted\ntbe fact, as the senator'always mis\ntrusted anything that he hadn't\nwritten himself.\nIf free trade with Canada becomes\na law, the lumber industry will be\nthe principal sufferer, and will be\nsacrificed in response to the unin\nformed popular demand. No one in\nside or outelde of congress except per\nhaps the representatives from Wash\nington, Oregon and other Pacific\nstates, who are familiar with the\nlumber Industry and know the de\npression sure to result from putting\nCanadian forest products on the free\nlist, will offer any serious objection to\nwhat President Taft believes is a\npublic demand. There Is nothing in\nsight for lumbermen but humble sub\nmission, realizing that \"to spend or\nto lend or to give in, it's a very good\nworld that we live in, but to borrow\nor beg or get one's own, it's the very\nworst world that ever was known.\nFairview.\nToo late for last week.\nFeb. 15, 1911\nAlthough winter started out quite\nsevere last week, spring seems to be\nwith us at present and with the dense\nfog and the many water puddles all\naround one would really think they\nwere living in Holland.\nIt is said that Ed Sorum has mo\nnopolized all the sleighing and we\ndon't doubt it.\nLouis Christopherson disposed of all\nhis cattle Saturday, selling them toI\nH.

Of course, some of\nthem objected to a struggle with Rus\nsian peasants, but their desire to see\ntheir own sons back on the farms, had\nsomething to do with their protest.\nThey made their wishes known\nthrough the county council.\nFARMERS ARE OF\nTHE SAME MIND.\nWhen Wentworth county council\nprotested against Canadian interfer\nence in Russia it was, in reality, a\nfarmers' protest. The representatives\nof this prosperous Ontario county\npassed these resolutions and instruct\ned the clerk to send a copy to Sir\nThomas White, acting premier of\nCanada while Sir Robert Borden is at\nthe peace conference: \"That this\ncouncil wishes to express its disap\nproval of any further drafts of Cana\ndian soldiers being sent to Russia and\nalso states that in its opinion the\ndrafts already sent should be imme\ndiately recalled, believing as it does\nthat it is a very unwise policy now\nthat the war is won that Canada\nshould interfere in the internal affairs\nof any other country.\"\nThat these county councillors re\nflected the opinion held by Ontario's\nfarmers is evident if one can believe\nPeter McArthur, well known as a\nwriter on farm topics, who declared\nthat farmers wanted Canada to keep\nout of the Russian trouble. In his\nweekly article in the farm section of\nthe Toronto Globe, a newspaper which\nsupports ^the Borden government, Mr.\nMcArthur said: \"A matter that is in\nneed of light at the present time is the\nCanadian expedition to Siberia. Boys\nfrom this district volunteered for that\nwork, and now people are beginning\nto wonder what it is all about and why\nwe should go on With it. There is no\nlonger any plan to attack Germany on\nthe eastern front. As a matter of\nfact, the expedition to Siberia can\nhave no possible connection with the\nwar with Germany, since it is now\nover\u2014or in such condition that it can\nnot be resumed. The expedition must\nnow be concerned only with the work\nof restoring law and order in that\nvast welter of humanity called Rus\nsia. Surely Canada has not become\nso great a world power that she must\nundertake to police other nations\u2014\n'the lesser breeds without the law.'\"\nThe Globe itself questioned the wis\ndom of Canada's entrance into Rus\nsian affairs and one of several edi\ntorials on Russia that appeared in this\ninfluential daily newspaper declared:\n\"The Canadian people are entitled at\nleast to an explanation of the objects\nwhich are said to require the presence\n\u2022of Canadian troops in Siberia. The\ndispatches from there report a series\nof squabbles between classes of Rusr\nsians whom the allies are supposed to\nbe backing against the Bolsheviki in\nthe name of order and, stable adminis\ntration. Are these factions\nworth fighting for? Are the allies\nunder any obligation to prevent them\nfrom flying at each other's throats?\"\nThe Globe had the support of other\ndaily newspapers quite as emphatic in\ntheir opposition to the Bolsheviki and\nno less faithful in their sapport of the\nBorden Unionist party. Two of these\nnewspapers are printed in Hamilton,\nthe city which S. C. Mewburn, Cana\nda's minister of militia and com\nmander-in-chijef of her military forces,\nrepresents in parliament.

KING, which occurred one\nyear ago today (April 19, 1910), and as evidence\nof the respect we entertain for his memory, we\nwant to recall to the minds of our readers, his\nfaultless life and character and well known\nhigh ideals of citizenship.\nWe doubt if we could do better than take\nhis exemplary life as our constant guide and\nmonitor.\nE9\nHi\nKEOIPKOUITY AND THE FARMEK.\nHaving heard several fanners express fear that the Reciprocity\nAgreement with Canada, now before our National Congress for rati\nfication or rejection, would prove detrimental to their best interests\nby cautsiiig a reduction in the market price of farm products, we have\ntaken the trouble to investigate our government statistics on the sub\nject and find that for the live years ending June 80, 1910, our business\nwith Canada was as follows:\nHorses:\nWe sold in Canada $14,172,075\nCanada sold to us 2,519,201\nDifference in our favor \". $ U,G22,874\nCattle:\ni\n384,383\n1G,10G,82G\nWe sold in Canada 1,578,179\nCanada sold to us 1,193,790\nDifference in our favor\njNleat and Dairy:\nWe sold in Canada.... ;. 17,011,017\nCanada sold to us : 904,191\nDifference in our favor.\nBreadstuff's:\nWe told in Canada ; . 31 ,596,550\nCanada sold to us ,(570,S84\nDifference in our favor\nIn goods of all kinds: '\nWe sold m Canada 880,417,370\nCanada sold to us 303,913,072\nDifference in 'our favor \" 492,505,703\nWhy should we want to put a tariff wall between our country and\none which buys more from us than it sells to us? Why shut ourselves\nin from such a market? Of course the paper trust and wood pulp\ntrust objectf to a reduction in the cost of paper, but we fail to see why\nthe farmer should oppose an increase in the demand for his products\nby enlarging the market.\n24,910,072\nPAY CASH FOR BRICK STREETS.\nWe are informed that the contractors who propose to bid on our\nbrick streets will make a much lower bid if assured that all, or the\nmajor portion of the work, will be paid for in cash when completed,\nthan they will, if required to wait indefinitely for their money. Being\nO. B. PATTEKSOIS\", Cashier\nnon-residents, they prefer to work for cash, rather than have, their pay\nrun through a term of years. Under the plan proposed, a citizen ina.y\npay for his proportionate part of the work in cash, or in ten yearly\npayments, with interest.\nIn vicv of thp contractors offer and in order to get the advantaie\nof this special price for cash, Messrs. C. C. Chenault and G. -H.\nStrollicr of the Brick Paving Commission, are circulating a petition\namong the property-owners in the district to be paved and nearly\nevery one of them, when the matter is explained to him, has agreed to\npay in cash. Those who have not done so, should see Mr. Chenault or\nMr. Strother at once and thus help to get the proposed special rate.\nThe contract will be let Thursday, April, 20th,' and the streets will\ncost much less and it will prove more satisfactory to all concerned, if\nthe work is paid for in cash, when completed and accepted.\nA.

As the Chinese exclusion\nact permits the treasury depart\nment to return Chinese immigrants\nto the country \"from which they\ncame\" this opinion in effect declared\nthat Canada was not an asylum of\nrefuge for Chinamen and that when\ncaught they could be shipped to\nChina and not merely to Canada.\nr It has never done any good to\nreturn them to Canada, as they\nwould slip across the border again.\nmust stop tiie crusade.\nActing on the attorney-general's\nopinion, many Chinamen have been\n* stopped at border points. Some of\nthem have hired lawyers and\nfought the attorney-general's view,\nand today word was received that\nthat a test case at Detroit had\nbeen so decided that the treasury\ndepartment would have to bring\nits Chinese crusade to an end.\nThe collector of customs at Detroit\ntelegraphed Secretary Spaulding\nthat Judge Swan of the United\nStates district court had decided\nthat Canada was the country from\nwhich the Chinese came when they\ngot into this country by way of our\nnorthern neighbor. This was di\nrectly in the face of the attorney\ngeneral 's opinion, and if Judge\nSwan 's rule was followed, China\nen could not be sent back to\nChina. Secretary Spaulding was\nnaturally loath to accept such a\nruling, but there was no alterna\ntive.\nThe attorney-general's view was\nmerely an opinion which had no\nbinding effect, but the Swan de\ncision came from a federal court.\nThe acting secretary therefore tele\ngraphed that the decision of Judge\nSwan would be accepted by the\ntreasury department aB final unless\nsome method of appeal to the\nsupreme court could be devised.\nThere is no appeal, however, and\nthe treasury officials feel that the\nwar of exclusion against the Chi\nnese is suddenly brought to an end\nSecretary Spaulding said that if\nthe border courts wished to con\nstrue the law so as to tavor the\nChinese immigration the treasury\nwould give up its efforts until con\ngress came together and changed\nthe law.\n^rm\n^ m\ncanada will profit by it.\nThis end of the controversy\nmeans much to Canada in the way\nof revenue, as the dominion will\nnow become a thoroughfare for Chi\nnamen en route to this country,\neach of whom pays $50 head tax to\nCanada. Four shiploads of China\nmen arrive in Vancouver every\nmonth. There were 7,900 China\nmen landed frctn January 1 to\nJuly 15 last, and 7,000 were des\ntined for the United States. Cana\nda's income on the traffic for this\nperiod was $395,000. The activity\nof the treasury detectives and offi\ncials has been the only thing which\nhas in any way limited the influx\nthus far, but with the acceptance\nof the Swan decision as final today\nthe treasury agents are brought to\na standstill, and the bars are prac\ntically thrown down for the incom\ning Chinamen.\nEx-Congressman W W.Morrow,\nwho was recently appointed by\nPresident Harrison to the federal\ncircuit bench of California, is one\nof the few Americah8 who ever\ncame near being made a king.\nSome years ago when Germany\nwas encroaching upon Samoa, Mr.\nMorrow took up the cause of the\nislanders and secured for them\ngood-will as well as financial help\nin some of the Pacific coast sta\ntions. Samoans recognizsd the\nservice of the Californian and asked\nhim to accept the position of prime\nminister, which officer was virtu\nally the ruler of Samoan affairs.\nIt was understood at the time that\na ministry would be a stepping\nstone to the more important place\nof the actual head of Samoa.\nJudge Morrow gracefully but\nfirmly refused the position.\nEx-Senator Blanche K. Bruce of\nMississippi has held the highest\nofficial position ever attained by a\ncolored man in this country, hav\ning at one time presided over the\nUnited States senate. Mr. Bruce's\nson was named after Roscoe Conk\nlin, in recognition of a courtesy\nwhich Conklin first Bhowed him\nwhen he first entered the senate.\nIt was time for Mr. Bruce to be\nsworn in, but his republican col\nleague, Senator Alcorn, escorting\nhim to the vice-president's desk,\nquietly ienored him. Then Mr.\nConklin quickly arose and grace\nfully performed the service.\nRoger Q. Mills is forcing tariff\nreform as the issue in Ohio politics.\nMcKinley has dropped the tai iff\nquestion and now dilates upon the\nevils of free coinage. Here we\nhave the strange spectaele of a lead\ning free coinage democrat and the\nleading protection apostle of the\ncountry both afraid to stand by\ntheir principles. In the existence\nof such hypocrisy as this there is\nplenty of excuse for a people's\nparty. _____\nIndian Territory has witnessed\nanother land \"rush\" this week.\nThis time 15,000 boomers were after\n5,000 homesteads. It does not\ntake much calculation to figure out\nthat there were at least 10,000 dis\nappointed persons in that country\nthe day after the \"rush.\" Two\ntowns of from 1200 to 2500 inhab\nitants were made in a day.\nMills is for free trade and\nSpringer is for free silver.

Canada Is\npractically free from horse and cattle\ndiseases, and the wish of the authori\nties Is to keep it so.\nRecently, though, an order has been\nissued by the Department of Agricul\nture, removing the embargo, and set\ntlers are now free to take In the num\nber of head of horses or cattle that are\npermitted by the Customs authorities\nand the freight regulations. This will\nbe welcome news to those whose In\ntention it Is to move to Canada, taking\nwith them stock that they have had in\ntheir possession for six months, and\nwhich It is the intention to use on land\nthgt they will farm In the Provinces\nof Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Alberta.\nThere are thousands of splendid\nhomesteads of 160 acres each In any\nof these provinces, that may be had\nupon tho payment of a ten-dollar en\ntry fee and fulfilling the requisite liv\ning and cultivation duties. These\nlands are well adapted to the growing\nof all the small grains, and besides,\nhaving an abundance of grass, and suf\nficient shelter, they are well adapted\nto the raising of stock.\nIf one prepares to purchase land,\nthere could be no better time than the\npresent. Prices are low, and particu\nlars may be had from any of the land\ncompanies, of which there are several,\nor from the Canadian Pacific and Ca\nnadian Northern railways, whose hold\nings are In the older settled districts,\nand whoso terms are exceedingly easy\nto the settler. What these lands will\ndo in the matter of production cannot\nbe more strongly emphasized than hi\nreading the reports of the crops\nthroughout all parts of the Canadian\nWest In 1916. Yields of 60. 60, and as\nhigh as 70 bushels of wheat to *the\nacre were numerous, while reports of\n>lelds cf from 30 to 46 bushels per\nAcre were common. Oats as high as\n130 bushels per acre are reported. 60\nand 60 bushels per acre being ordi\nnary. Tho prices realized by farmers\nhave placed most of them on \u201ceasy\nstreet.\u201d\nLately there have appeared articles\nin a number of United States news\npapers to the effect that there was con\nscription In Canada, or that such a\nlaw was likely to be put into effect.\nWe have it from the highest authority\nin the Dominion that there is no truth\nIn the statement. Sir R-bert Bcrden\nat the opening of Canadian parliament\non January 17th. said:\n\u201cIn the first few months of the war\nI clearly stated that there would not\nbe conscription In Canada. I repeat\nthat statement today.\u201d\nThis statement should set at rest\nthe conscription talk that has been so\nfreely used to influence those who may\nbe considering settling in Canada dur\nalso been said that there w-as\nI tax on land. Hon. Dr Roche.\nMinister of the Interior, over his own\nsignature has denied this, and the pr\nmters of the different provinces Join\n\u201c saying \"such a report is absolutely\nitoLruo. agd baa no foundation wljst- |\never In fact, nor is there likely aver\nto be any such tax upon land In\nCanada.\u201d\nThe general prosperity of Western\nCanada farmers and business Institu\ntions Is such that Canada Is well able\nto take care of the extra war expenses\nwithout any direct war taxation. This\nhas been well Illustrated by the mag\nnificent response to the Dominion Gov\nernment\u2019s recent bond Issue, which\nwas more than doubly subscribed for\nwithin the first eight hours of its be\ning offered to the public.\n(The above appears as an advertise\nment and is paid for by the Dominion\nGovernment which authorizes its pub\nlication.)\nA new fishhook has prongs along its\nshank to hold live batt with a mini\nmum of injury.\nGJW CROSS\nFEVERISH, SICK\nLook, Mother!

Sir Thomas told the com\nmittee quite frankly that to issue any\nla rye sum of government bonds to sol\ndiers, as is proposed by one of their\nleaders, would greatly influence the\ncredit of Canada, still further inflate\nprices and affect the cost of living.\n\"If any such issue of bonds were\nmade how could Canada float another\nloan?\" Sir Thomas asked. \"The ef\nfect would at once be felt in the\nUnited States, where our credit and\nfinancial standing- are always import-\niwv nnnriQ qtorf top II\nSaturday Is Last Day of Thrift\nWeek Sale !\nSAVE-10 Discoimt-SAVE\nant. There is only one other country\nin the world that ia on a better basis\nthan Canada; that is the United\nSlates, the only country now on a\ngold basis.\n\"Canada has 4 0 per cent of gold\nagainst all her currency and large\nsums to her credit abroad, and this\ncountry should aim to get back on the\nsafe basis of gold without any need\nless delay. Once on a gold basis there\nwould be no question of exchange\ndiscount, and the cost of living would\nbe directly affected for prices would\ncome down. At present there Is In\nflation of prices and of currency. The\nsooner the country is run on a close\neconomy and retrenchment policy the\nsafer it will be.\"\nBritain Xocds Credit.\nSpeaking of an issue of Government\nbonds, Sir Thomas said it would be\nnecessary for two years at least to ex\ntend credit to Great Britain.\n'By such credit our farmers were\nable to market their goods and get\ncash,\" he said. 'A1 this date there\nare some $170,000,000 outstanding\nagainst Great. Britain over and above\ncontra -war claims; and $25,000,000\neach against 1' ranee. Belgium, Greece\nand Rumania, besides $6,000,000\nagainst Italy. To continue to extend\ncredit would test the financial power\nof Canada, without resort to special\ngrant.\"\nThe Canadian customs tariff was\nchiefly levied on an ad valorem\nbasis, Sir Thomas said. He foresaw\nthe coming of lower prices by a grad\nual process, which meant less revenue\nfor Canada. The income tax of the\ncountry is now on the level of the\nUnited States, and the business profits\ntax higher than the American, he said.\nHe hoped for $25,000,000 from the In\ncome tax in the current fiscal year.\n\"But there is a limit In Income tax\npossibility for Canada,\" he said. \"In\nGreat Britain there is large accumu\nlated wealth and large business and\nfinancial tesourccs to draw upon, but\nthey are limited in Canada.\"\nJ. A. Calder, chairman of the com\nmittee, lakes a serious view of the\nsoldiers' demands. He estimates it\nwill cost from $400,000,000 to $800.\n000,000 to pay the soldiers' plan.\nInflation Is Blamed.\n\"Now from my reading of the situ\nation as it exists, not only in Canada\nbut the world round, economists hold\nthe view that the high cost of living\nin practically all countries, and partic\nularly in the recently belligerent\ncountries, is due largely to the infla\ntion of currency and the reduction of\nthe credit, of these countries a reduc\ntion of the actual value of the dollar\nas a result of debts created.\"\nThe Deputy Minister of Finance\ngave, some complete figures on af\nfairs. The total revenue of Canada\nfor the last fiscal year was $312,\n9 16,747; customs made up $147,169,\n187; excise, $30,342,034; income tax,\n$10,992,123; pout office and railways\naccount for $70,354,411, and other\nsources and taxes for the balance. The\nregular expenditure on war last fiscal\nyear was $446,519,439, and for the\ncurrent, year is estimated at $350,000,\n000. The net debt of Canada, March\n31, 1920, would be $1,950,000,000. But\nthis year's consolidated revenue re\nceipts were estimated at $280,000,000.\nIncome tax had been levied on\n51,588 people in 1917, and the amount\nof assessment was $12,221,669. Only\n47,091 people paid and the amount\ncollected was just over $10,000,000.\nOnly 32,668 persons paid on incomes\nbetween $1,500 and $6,000, and $1,\n469,000 was collected from them.

The latter passed it on to the\nForeign Office, who then communicated with the Brit\nish Embassy at Washington, and at length after many\nweary weeks the United States Government was\nreached.\nDuring the later stages of the war many ot these\nantiquated formalities were relaxed and there was a\ncertain measure of direct intercourse between Ottawa\nand Washington, but in the eyes of the British official\nhierarchy it was quite improper. However, Canadian\nnational sentiment has thrived greatly since 1914. The\nexploits of the Canadian army and the magnitude of\nthe national war effort have roused in the people a\nnew sense of confidence and pride and it is generally\nagreed that there is no department of national life\nwhich Canadians cannot manage for themselves better\nthan other people can manage for them.\nCanada and the other British dominions occupy\nstrangely anomalous positions. They are national states\nin strength and self -consciousness but in form and\nstatus are still colonial dependencies. Britain lost her\nfirst empire by the fatal folly of George V and Lord\nNorth, and a hundred years ago apart from her Indian\nholdings and several tropical islands, she could point\nto only a few scattered settlements in the vast terri\ntory which ic had brought under her flag.\nThe colonists were engaged in a desperate struggle\nwith the wilderness; they were absolutely under the\ncontrol of Downing Street ; their governors were mostly\ngeneral! with bad livers and tempers, and their of\nnciall were the needy scions of aristocratic families.\nTheir atYairs were invariably managed in the interests\nof the mother country and in return British taxpayers\nwere good enough to bear the cost of their defense.\nThe wishes of the colonists were rarely consulted, and\nengaged as the latter were in an absorbing conflict with\nnature, they had scant time for political thought and\norganization.\nBut when the pioneers had surmounted their worst\nstruggles and settlement became thicker, they became\nconscious of their disabilities and the old British sense\nof liberty asserted itself. There came a political awak\nening and a demand for responsible government. It\nrenuired an actual rebellion in\nCanada, in 1M7, headed by Wil\nliam Lyon Mackenzie, grand\nlather of Mackenzie King, the\npresent leader of Canadian Lib\nerals, to bring matters to a head.\nThe rebellion was suppressed but\nit educated the British Govern\nment to the fact that unless\ntimely changes were made their\nlater empire would go the way\nof the first.\nThe steps were gradual ; first,\nthe Dominions began to make\ntheir own financial arrangements\nand tariffs; next, they assumed\nresponsibility for their own de\nfense ; they began later on to\nregulate their immigration pol\nicy and to negotiate treaties\nthrough their own plenipoten\ntiaries, as in the case of the Taft\nKiclding reciprocity pact of 1911.\nOther milestones of constitu\ntional development were passed\nduring the war years. The\nCanadian premier and other min\nisters were accorded places in\nthe Imperial War Cabinet on a\nparity with British ministers and\nCanada was accorded separate\nrepresentation at the Peace Con\nference and in the League of\nNations. American Senators\nand others who saw in this step\na Machiavellian scheme on the\npart of the British statesmen to\nsecure additional votes for the\nBritish people err profoundly.\nThe hierarchy of the British\nforeign Office made no secret of\ntheir Confidence in tin ir rnnnritv\nto look after the foreign affairs\ni the Dominions and it WAS only the determined in\nttltence f Sir Hubert Borden and General Smuts which\n?W the right of separate representation.\nl-.'-t September one of the Canadian delegates, Mr.\nSifton, publicly stated in the House at Ottawa that\nWrate representation was seemed for the Dominions\nonly because of the opposition of the most con\nservative elements in Britain. If the old principle Ol\npting the Dominions what powers they wanted had not\nJJjn adhered to, the Dominion delegates would prob\nity have shaken the dust of Paris off their feet and a\nserious crisis would have arisen. But the British\nlrnpenahsts do not like these new claims of the Do\nminions. They hanker after some form of an Im\nperial centralized Parliament, which will give them a\ncnance of controlling the daughter states.\nI he supporters of Imperial Federation are cherish\n,n8 an impossible dream. It has been repudiated by\nail the responsible statesmen in the Dominions and any\ngovernment which proposed it would have no chance\n01 ,urvval. The ties of common laws, traditions, cus-\nBy J. A. STEVENSON\ntoms and language between Britain and her daughter\nstates are strong and deep, but so intense is the new\nnational consciousness in each of them that they will\nresolutely decline to enter into any binding political\narrangements which might hamper their freedom of\naction. In an Imnerial Par\nliament the dominating ma\njority for many years would\nbe drawn from the mother\ncountry.\nSo far from showing a\nwillingness to continue in a\nstate of indefinite subordi\nnation, the Canadian people\nare anxious to extend their\nautonomous powers, and the\nappointment of a special\nCanadian minister at Wash\nington is a step in this di\nrection. He will take\neharge of ordinary Ca\nnadian affairs and will act\nas the normal channel of\ncommunication between the\nCanadian and American\ngovernments in matters\nsolely pertaining to Canada,\nkwlsHte MP\nv\nNEWTON W. LOWELL\nSIR ROBERT BORDEN\nreceiving his instructions\nfrom and reporting di\nrect to the Cabinet at\nOttawa. In the absence\nof the British Ambas\nsador, the Canadian min\nister will automatically\nassume charge of the\nBritish embassy and at\ntend to Imperial as well\nas Canadian interests.\nThough Sir George Fos\nter took pains to assert\nthat the step did not af\nfect the diplomatic unity\nof the British Common\nwealth, yet it obviously\nconstitutes a far-reaching\ninnovation and it will\nnot be popular in Im\nperialist circles in Kng\nland where it will be\nasked if this sort of\nthing will not end in\ncomplete independence.\nThere is no criticism\nin Canada of the step\nitself but objection has\nbeen raised both inside\nand outside Parliament\nto the fact that this im\nportant departure was\narranged by secret nego\ntiations between the\nBritish and Canadian governments and Parliament was\nnot consulted. . .\nBut, generally speaking, the new1 ministry meets a\ngrowing desire on the part of the Canadian people\nOften in the past it has been brought home to them that\nhowever brilliant and capable the staff of the British\nembassy might be, they were always Englishmen and\nprimarily concerned with English interests. The charge\nwas often brought that they were always ready to sac\nrifice Canadian interests to pacify the American btate\nDepartment and the memory of the Alaska boundary\ndecision when Lord Alverstone, the British representa\ntive voted with the American delegates against the\nCanadian claims, still rankles. Again during the war\nthe British Government deliberately preferred to in\nterpret its case through its own emissaries rather than\nthrough Canadians whose services were proffered and\nwho had an infinitely better acquaintance with America\nand her viewpoint. ,\nThe need for easy and direct relations between the\ntwo countries was never greater. The total volume of\nC. A. MAGRATH\nChairman ol the Canadian Section of the International\nWaterways Commission.\ntrade between Canada and the United States was in the\nlast fiscal year twice as much as the commerce between\nGreat Britain and Canada and for the first time in\nmany years Canada exported more goods to the United\nStates than to the mother country. She is dependent\non her southern neighbor for large quantities of coal\nand coke to supply her central areas as well as much\nraw material for industries which are coalless. Amer\nicans, on the other hand, are more and more becoming\ndependent on Canada for\ntheir supplies of newsprint\nand pulpwood and the move\nwhich Senator Underwood\nhas initiated to secure the\nabrogation of the restrictions\nof the Canadian provinces\nupon the export of pulpwood\ngrown on crown lands is re\ngarded as a provocative in\nterference with the domestic\naffairs of another country\nand might, if pressed, give\nrise to a delicate situation.\nWater rights on the rivers\nand streams which form or\ncrovs the international boun\ndary give rise to continual\ndisputes in regard to water\npower and irrigation schemes.\nIn the near future, through\nthe acquisition of the Grand\nTrunk Railway and its sub\nsidiaries, the Canadian Gov\nernment will own a large rail\nway mileage under the Stars\nand Stripes, and its opera\ntion may give rise to com\nplicated problems.\nThere is a continual ex\nodus of American farmers\nnorthward to the cheaper\nlands of the Canadian North\nwest and a counter exodus southward of people who\ndislike the Canadian winter or want a change of oc\ncupation or residence. In fact the balance in migra\ntion is in favor of the United States who in the last\neleven years received almost 200,000 more people from\nCanada than they sent to her.\nBut the sense of the deep community of interest\nbetween the two countries is daily growing and proofs\narc visible on every side. The American Federation\nof Labor, which has the allegiance of most Canadian\nunions, meets in Montreal on June 7, and on May 12\nrepresentatives of the Canadian Council of Agriculture\nand the National Board of Farm Organizations of the\nUnited States met in Chicago to discuss the establish\nment of an international board of agriculture. Under\nsuch conditions, need of direct diplomatic intercourse\nbetween the two great democracies of North America\nhas become absolutely imperative.\nThere is general agreement in Canada that she must\nnot be represented in this experiment by anybody of\ninferior standing or quality. The name of Sir Charles\nGordon, a leading manufacturer and financier of\nMontreal who had charge of the Canadian Mission at\nWashington during the war, receives wide support in\nbusiness circles but he has had no political experience\nand would probably be unwilling to give up his very\nextensive business enterprises for a diplomatic career.\nSir J. D. Hazen, the Chief Justice of New Bruns\nwick, who was Minister of Marine and Fisheries in\nthe first Borden Cabinet, has some supporters but his\nabilities and standing are scarcely commensurate with\nthe post.\nA generally acceptable selection would be Mr. C. A.\nMagrath, the senior Canadian representative on the\nJoint International Commission. Mr. Magrath has had\npeculiar experience for the position ; he had a success\nful business career as manager of the Southern Al\nberta Irrigation Company and served for a term as a\nConservative member of the House of Commons. If\nhe had stayed in politics he would long ago have been\nin the Dominion Cabinet. But his views were in ad\nvance of his party and he preferred the independence\nof his present position. He enjoys general popularity\nand esteem in Canada and did excellent service during\nthe war as Fuel Controller for Canada. This business\nas well as his duties on the Joint Commission have made\nhim a frequent visitor at Washington and he has a first\nclass knowledge of the United States.\nBut Canada may be able to send an even more il\nlustrious personage as her first Minister to Washington.\nSir Robert Borden, the Canadian Premier, has just re\nturned to Ottawa after a prolonged holiday at southern\nhealth resorts, where he was trying to recover from a\nserious breakdown in health, the result of his exertions\nduring the war. While he is much improved by hi\nrest, it is considered doubtful if his physicians will\nallow him to resume the arduous duties of the premier\nship. If he is compelled or decides to retire, an effort\nwill probably be made to induce him to inaugurate the\nCanadian Ministry at Washington and as he is by no\nmeans an old man, he may be willing to accept it.\nWhile his domestic policy does not command universal\napproval, all parties have confidence in the soundness\nof his views upon foreign affairs and his appointment\nwill be acclaimed as exceedingly satisfactory. It is\nunderstood that he was offered the British embassy in\n1919 but declined to accept it. If he went to Wash\nington now the British Government would probably\npay him the compliment of withdrawing Sir Auckland\nGeddcs and entrusting all their interests to his ex\nperienced supervision.", "batch": "mimtptc_jackson_ver01", "title_normal": "dearborn independent.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/2013218776/1920-06-26/ed-1/seq-7.json", "place": ["Michigan--Wayne--Dearborn"], "page": "7"}, {"sequence": 6, "county": ["Lancaster"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Monthly", "id": "/lccn/46032385/1912-09-20/ed-1/seq-6/", "subject": ["Lancaster County (Neb.)--Newspapers.", "Lincoln (Neb.)--Newspapers.", "Middle class--United States.", "Middle class.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01020437", "Nebraska--Lancaster County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01211912", "Nebraska--Lincoln.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01208321", "Politics and government--fast--(OCoLC)fst01919741", "United States--Politics and government--1865-1933--Newspapers.", "United States.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204155"], "city": ["Lincoln"], "date": "19120920", "title": "The commoner.

D., would lose about\n26 cents per bushel.\nAllowing wheat to come in from Canada free,\nno one can ship wheat from Winnipeg to Min\nneapolis or Duluth, including shipping charges,\nwithout a loss of about 20 cents per bushel.\nThe eastern manufacturer wants the farmer\nto believe that he gets more for his grain on\naccount of the tariff, so that the farmer will be\nwilling to pay about two prices for the manu\nfactured articles he buys. The truth is, the\nfarmer is paying more for what ho buys, with\nout getting any more for what he sells, than as\nthough there had been no tariff on wheat and\ncorn.\nIn Canada $16 will buy as good a suit of cloth\ning, as good an overcoat, as good a dress or as\ngood a woman's coat as $30 will buy in the\nUnited States.\nCounting wheat at $1 per bushel in both\ncountries, and clothing of the same quality, in\ntrading wheat for clothing you have this result:\nOne suit clothing 16 bu. wheat\nOno overcoat 16 bu. wheat\nOne woman's coat 16 bu. wheat\nOne woman's dress 16 bu. wheat\nTotal .'. 64 bu. wheat\nIn the United States\n.One suit clothing ....30 bu. wheat\nOno overcoat 30 bu. wheat\nOne woman's dress 30 bu. wheat\nOno woman's coat 30 bu. wheat\nTotal 120 bu. wheat\nWho gets tho extra fifty-six bushels of wheat\nthat tho farmer in the United States pays for his\nfour garments?\nIt is tho local merchant? No.\nIt is the factory laborer? No. He gets an\naverage of less than $1.40 per day.\nIt is tho manufacturer of the cloth and the\nmanufacturer of the clothing who got tho extra\nfifty-six bushels of wheat on account of tho\ntariff. The farmer gets no more for his horses,\ncattle, hogs, wheat or corn than ho would if\nthere were no tariff on those products of the\nfarm. Today a good span of horses is worth\n$100 more in Canada than in the United States.\nWages are higher in Winnipeg than in Min\nneapolis, but for comparison we will call thom\nthe same common labor $3 per day in either\ncity. In Canada the laborer will buy a much\nbetter suit of clothing for $12 than he can get\nin tho United States for $18.\nIn tho two countries, in trading labor for\nclothing, we have this result:\nIn Canada\nOno suit of clothing, 4 days' work $12\nOno overcoat, 4 days work $12\nIn tho United States\nOne suit of clothing, 6 days' work $18\nOno overcoat, 6 days' work $18\nWages are much higher in Canada than in tho\nUnited States and there is a large demand for\nlabor.\nSection men, who work on the railroads in\nCanada, are paid $2.40 per day.\nA resident of Saskatoon, Can., a place of 15,\n000 to 20,000 people, told your correspondent\nthat the following wages are paid there:\nCarpenters 55 cents per hour\nBrick masons 65 cents per hour\nPlasterers 70 cents per hour\nFrom all this ono must conclude that the so\ncalled protective tariff does not give higher\nprices to the farmer or the laborer in the United\nStates, but that it makes both pay more for liv\ning supplies.\nThis tariff puts the robber in the home, where\nhe takes about 35 per cent more than a fair\nprice out of every dollar spent for domestic sup\nplies. It is not a protective, but rather a destruc\ntive tariff. George T. Baker in Omaha World-Herald.\nWILSON ON PARMER PROTECTION\nThe theory, doctrine and claim that protection\nadvantages the farmer, upon which the republi\ncan party has so persistently and insistently rung\ntho changes, never mot with more complete an\nnihilation than they suffored at the hands of\nGovernor Wilson in a speech he made in\nPennsylvania the other day. The American\nfarmer, Governor Wilson asserted, has never\nneeded protection for the reason, which con\nstitutes \"an economical fact,\" that he has never\nneeded protection, since his grains have been\nsold at prices established by the prices which\nhis produce commanded in foreign markets.\nThe prices the farmer receives, he continued,\nin further impressing his position as to the con\ntrolling relation of \"an economic fact\" to the\nquestion, are not established by protection. They\nare established by your (the farmers') abun\ndance, which you ship to foreign countries.- From\nrecognition of tho absolute cogency of this\nreasoning and the unassailability of the con\nclusion there is no escape.\nBut Governor Wilson did not stop there.\nTurning to tho disadvantages to tho farmer in\nvolved in \"protection\" high tariff he affirmed\nthat meantime everything used on the farm,\neverything the farmer needs, a great deal of\nwhat he eats but does not himself produce, in\ncluding meats, bears a heavy duty, \"which\nbrings about the interesting result that you (the\nfarmers) are paying for the wealth of the United\nStates and getting nothing equivalent, so far as\nthe tariff is concerned.\" A bomb, verily, of con\ncentrated fact and logic Governor Wilson hurled\ninto the protection camp in the above exposition.\nHe not only proved that the farmer is not pro\ntected, but demonstrated, to the contrary, that\nhe was mercilessly preyed upon for the benefit\nof tho favored few; that the agricultural in\nterests, considering their Immensity, have been\nand are being made the chief source for glutting\nprotection vampiroism.\nHis proof on the ono point and his demon\nstration as to the other refute in a nutshell\nevery contention that has been advanced in ex\nploitation of protection as the \"farmers' friend \"\nThey are so clear and convincing that it is im\npossible to comprehend how any farmer gifted\nwith even the most elementary ability to grasp\nthem can fail of understanding that the tariff\nis his worst enemy. It is difficult to conceive\nhow he can fail to recognize that just in propor\ntion as he accepts the high tariff doctrine ho\nbecomes the dupe and the tool of the special\ninterests and engages in cutting his own purse\nand throat and the purses and throats of the\nmasses is guilty of economic suicide. Rich\nmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch.\nTARIFF MAKES LIVING HIGH\nThe real facts about the present tariff are\nbeing published by the New York World in a\nseries of articles based upon information\n- VOLUME 12, NUMBER 37\ngathered by the tariff reform committee of tho\nReform club of New York, a non-partisan or\nganization. There are about 22 million households in tho\nUnited States. That not 'ono of them escapes\ntho greed of tho , tariff-protected manufacturer\nwill bo very plainly seen by comparing export\nand domestic prices on articles of common uso\nin tho home.\nNearly everybody is familiar witli tho dis\ncrimination that has been practiced by tho\n\"Watch Trust\", against tho American consumer\nresulting in some merchants buying Elgin, Wal\ntham and other American watches cheaper in\nEuropo than tho trust sold them here and\nshipping them back to this country. But clocks\nare too bulky to make this practice profitable\nand tho American is helpless. '\nTHE KITCHEN FEELS IT\nTho American family meets tariff discrimina\ntion at every turn. To get breakfast they uso\na kitchen coffeo mill, which is offered for ex\nport at ninety cents, but to the American\npurchaser not under $1.13 one-fourth added to\nthe price while the tariff permits tho Ameri\ncan manufacturer to do business without com\npetition from abroad.\nTho oil heater on which the workingman's\nfamily might make a hasty cup of coffee and\nboil the eggs for breakfast if they could afford\neggs is sold for export at $2.20, but for tho\n\"protected\" American purchaser the price is 40\nper cent higher, or $3.08.\nA 2-quart aluminum coffeo pot, on which thero\nis protection of 45 per cent, is sold in this coun\ntry for $1.50, which is 44 per cent more than\ntho American manufacturer asks for it for ex\nport to any place not under protection's wing.\nOn Monday morning the American mother\nputs tho wash boiler on the tariff-taxed cook\nstove. A Peekskill, N. Y., manufacturer quoted\nthe tariff reform committee's \"export agent\"\n$15 as tho foreign price for tho stove he charges\n$20 for in this country because the government\nhas decreed a tax of 45 per cent on cook stoves.\nTAX! THE BABY CARRIAGE\nIf the American mother wishes to let her\nbaby sleep in tho baby carriage in the yard she\nmeets the tariff tax again. For Newfoundland\na leading American manufacturer quoted $9.50\nfor his baby carriage, but for all those who enjoy\ntho blessings of \"protection\" the wholesale price\nis $12.67, or one-third more. By a duty of\n45 per cent the American baby is often \"pro\ntected\" out of having any carriage at all. For\nthe poor the protective tariff has made a go-cart\na luxury.\nTuesday is ironing day, which the kind\nhearted protectionists have tried to make hap\npier for the house mother by compelling her to\npay nearly a third more for her flatirons, as is\nproved by the export prices quoted by Phila\ndelphia manufacturers. The heavier the iron\nthe greater the weight of protection, as it is fixed\nat four-fifths of a cent per pound. The set of\nsadirons these honest Quaker City people offer\nfor export at ninety-three cents they will sell to\nthe \"protected\" Americans for $1.23.\nMORE OF THE KITCHEN GRAFT\nThe meat chopper costs just double tho ex\nport price, the slaw and vegetable cutter and\nthe potato shredder cost two-fifths more than\nthey would. sell for across the line in Canada,\nand the pots and pans of aluminum come 50\nper cent dearer. It is chiefly due to that 45 per\ncent duty. ,\nEven tho vanilla flavoring extract for the\ncornstarch pudding costs the American family\na third more than for oxport to the foreign\nfamily.\nThe children's clothes have to be made, and\nthe domestic sewing machine is handy. It\nwould be just as handy, however, if tho Ameri\ncan family could get it for the export price,\n$18.62, instead of the $30 or more they have\nto pay. The $11.38 extra charged his wife for\nthis machine is a week's wages for many mil\nlions of American workingmen. Kansas City\nTimes.\nMr. Perkins is becoming more and more a\nload to Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Taft is beginning\nto feel the weight of J. Pierpont Morgan's in\ndorsement. The trust magnates are a liability\ninstead of an asest in a campaign.\nMr. Roosevelt continues to call Woodrow Wil\nson \"Doctor.\" Let it go at that. Dr. Wilson\nseems to be purging the body politics of a lot or\ndeleterious matter hence the scolding and the\nfulminating.\nr\nai&fc'4il\n..", "batch": "nbu_carson_ver02", "title_normal": "commoner.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/46032385/1912-09-20/ed-1/seq-6.json", "place": ["Nebraska--Lancaster--Lincoln"], "page": "6"}, {"sequence": 67, "county": ["New York"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83030214/1920-06-13/ed-1/seq-67/", "subject": ["New York (N.Y.)--Newspapers.", "New York (State)--New York County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01234953", "New York (State)--New York.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204333", "New York County (N.Y.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["New York"], "date": "19200613", "title": "New-York tribune.

You\ndesignate more particularly the lands in the Sas\nkatchewan and Carrot River Valleys and in tho\nGreat Saskatchewan Plains. I most cheerfully\ncomply. ' I like to talk about such a country.\nFrom Dauphin, 167 mile, northwest from Winnipeg, to\nKdmonton, a distance of 635 miles, lies a stretch of coun\ntry extending back from 20 to SO miles on both sides of\nthe C. N., the larger portion of which I regard as emi\nnently adapted to mixed farming, that Is, the growing of\nboth grain and live stock. Its adaptation to growing\nwheat, oats, barley, spelts, rye, peas and flax most assur\nedly ranks high. I have seldom ever seen such crops\ngrown anywhere aa were then being harvested In these\nscattered settlements.\nThe evidences of high adaptation for live stock produc\ntion are found not only In the exceptionally high yields\nfrom all tho coarse grain named, but m the luxuriance\nwith which wild and wine grasses grow.\nThe land In the Carrot River region, reached by a\nbranch line of the Canadian Northern, has been found to\nbe possessed of extraordinary grain producing power.- It\nembraces a large area lying north of the Canadian\nNorthern railway. The country known as the great Sas\nkatchewan Plains, also covering many miles square and\nlying south from the Canad lan Northern and In, nat\nural fertility. Is a garden spot of the Northwest.\nNowhere elue In all the North American continent can\nso large an area of high class farming lands be found.\nMuch of this land Is yet unoccupied. The question 'of\nthe character of the winter climate Is well answered In\nthe fact that winter wheat and red clover can be grown\nover much of this area.\nYours Truly,\n-fit-\nmil\n- - - - 1 ' 1 111 \" \" \" \"' '\"'\ni;;::,i:i:;:;i.;:i:f.Si;i?iSi5\nRead What B.

I have just completed a\ntrip over the main line of the Canadian North\nern R. R. from Portage la Prairie to Battleford,\nmaking a careful study of the capacity of the\ncountry tributary to the line, and In my Judg\nment I have never before seen so large a con\ntinuous area of consistently high class wheat\nland as during this trip.\nHere and there are a few spots where there\nhas been settlement long enough to furnish data\nof actual performance, and the yields this year\nare running an average of close to thirty bushels\nper acre, with many exceptional yields reaching\nforty bushels and even higher. The vast part\nof the area in question is unsettled, but in char\nacter of soil, and, what is still more Important,\nIn quality of sub-soil, it in no way materially\ndiffers from the fields from which the yields I\nhave quoted were obtained. .\nI am firmly convinced that within a very few\nyears Northwest Canada will produce a larger\nsurplus of wheat for the world's market than caa\nbe grown in any other country.\nYours truly.\nHARVESTING SCENE IN 1905 ON THE DESCHON PARM NEAR DAVIDSON, SASKATCHEWAN\nThis was the second crop harvested on this farm. The land was purchased by Mr. Deschon in 1903, the cost of the land being $?.00 per acre. It was\nbroken and put into crop the follrwing year. On this second crop, Mr. Deschon had 4,000 acres in wheat which yielded an average of thirty 'bushels to\nthe acre, which brought 725 cents per bushel on tract. The cost of operating the past season did not exceed $6. 00 per acre. In other words Mr. Deschon's\nproceeds from this amounted to $22.7 per acre, the cost of operating being $6.00 per acre gave him a net profit of $16.75 per acre, and a total net profit on\nthis farm for 1905 crop of $67,000.00.

From\nevery section of the room came a\nroar of sound that swept out on the\nstreet and was caught up and carried\nback by the crowd there which had\nbeen unable to get into the court\nroom. The cheering continued for\nfive minutes while Judge Globensky\nmade no effort to check it.\nThaw and his lawyers are fighting\nfor delay. Jerome's boast that Ver\nmont wanted none of Thaw has\nscared the entire Thaw party. The\nattorneys admitted that they do not\nwant to go up against a sure thing.\nSo they have filed a paper, purport\ning to discontinue the habeas corpus\nproceedings, which they state will\nhave the effect of putting Thaw back\nwhere he stood when originally ar\nrested and will necessitate his re\nmaining in Canada until the October\nterm of court.\nJerome today authorized the fol\nlowing statement: \"Harry K.

They are\nundoubtedly bright red Socialists and bulldozing\nbolsheviki, using those names in the sense in which\nthe papers of the Twin Cities use them to designate\ncertain dangerous elements, especially the farmers\nof North Dakota.\nI Here is what they have done according to the\nGrain Growers' Guide to date and worse outbreaks\nmay be expected any moment for such an irrespon\nsible and ignorant element. As a matter of fact they\nhave planned a war dance to be held in Toronto in\nDecember, if in truth Toronto is willing to be so\ndisgraced.\nEarly in November their leaders met in Toronto\nto consider questions of national policy preliminary\nto the big convention in December.

Exception was also taken to the ruling\nof the country through orders in council as being\ndirectly contrary to the spirit of representative\ngovernment.\n\"As a means of raising revenue a direct tax on\nunimproved land values, including all natural re\nsources, was advocated, also the principle of a,\nsharply graduated income tax, inheritance tax on\nlarge estates and similar taxes on the profits of\ncorporations. In connection with the latter the\ntaxing of watered stock was urged.\n\"Other reforms indorsed were the nationalization\nof all railway, telephone, telegraph and express\ncompanies, and similar public utilities. The gov\nernment was urged to refuse to alienate any more\nnatural resources, but instead to bring them into\nuse only under short-term leases.

On this page\nis an account of, some very significant\nsteps that are being taken by our Ca\nnadian neighbor. The yeast of democ\nracy is working wherever there\nare intelligent toilers.\nabolition of the patronage system and Dominion\nprohibition. The stand was taken that Canada\nshould not be tied up after the war by its represen\ntatives to imperial policies without the people first\nbeing given an opportunity to decide upon the mat,\nters involved.\"\nThe question of putting up farmer candidates for\nthe provincial legislature and the Dpminion legis\nlature was also considered, and for the time~being\nthe majority of the leaders decided to follow the\npractice in western Canada where the farmers have\nbeen wilder than those of eastern Canada for some\ntime.\n\"In western Canada,\" says the Guide, \"the prac\ntice has been where candidates of both parties agree\nto accept the farmers' platform and where these\nmen are acceptable to the farmers, not to take any\npart in the election but allow the candidates to\nfight it out between themselves. Where one candi\ndate accepts the' farmers' platform and the other\nrefuses to do so, the farmers support the favorable\ncandidate. Where neither party puts an acceptable\ncandidate in the field, the farmers are free to bring\nout an independent candidate where they so desire.\"\nWhether the Union abides by this plan or adopts\nthe plan how used by the Nonpartisan league in the\nStates or helps to form an independent farmer\nlabor party will depend on what the other big farm\norganizations decide to do. The prospects are\nstrong that they will take one or the other of the\nmore radical plans. The old plan noted above\nworks fairly well where vital changes in policy\nare not demanded and where about all the farmers\nask is friendly administration. But the Canadian\nfarmers are now demanding radical changes as or\nganized farmers and workers throughout the world\nare demanding, and the old plan of \"letting the in\u00ad\nHOW THEY SEE IT IN CANADA\nYoo\nwe AK& AU.

The point where the\nspecial interests can compromise is passed when\nfarmers demand higher taxation of unimproved\nland values and public, ownership of utilities. The\nfarmers, with labor and other glasses which may\nbe allied with them politically, must capture the\nnominations of one of the old parties, or they must\nact independently. No candidate whom the special\ninterests have a share in electing will carry out a\nplatform that strikes at the roots of special privi\nlege.\nThe Canadian common people,' in fact, are ad\nvancing rapidly toward a close political organiza\ntion of farmers, city workers and returned soldiers.\nBecause Canada has been in the war since 1914,\nthere is a larger percentage of returned soldiers\nand these are 95 per cent organized already for\npolitical action.\nSEE COMMON INTERESTS\nOF ALL TOILERS\nIn the number of the Grain Growers' Guide quoted\nabove there is a powerful cartoon in which a special\ninterest \"agitator\" .is saying to the city worker and\nthe soldier: \"You have no interests in .common\nwith the farmers\" labor is replying, \"You can't\nmislead us\" and the returned soldier says: \"We\nare all the same people. We all- have to work for\na living.\" And underneath the cartoon are the\nwords: \"The. thing for every man who labors to\ndo is to co-operate with his brother who labors and\nseek justice and equal rights for all and special\nprivilege for none.\"\nYes, the farmers of Canada are pretty \"wild.\"\nLike our farmers they have been tame under the\n^exactions of special privilege so long that the re\nassertion of their right to vote together for policies\nbeneficial to themselves seems to some people like\na return to savagery.. The farmers here and there,\nhowever, can well afford to let the pigs squeal bad\nnames. The burden of bearing the bad names is a\nlittle thing compared to the democratic reforms\nthat can be secured through these \"wild\" methods.\nKINGS ARE KINGS\nThe big press has been as busy perfuming some\nkings in recent months as it was in running down\nPreviously. The distinction is rather\nhard for the average man to get because as re\ngards democracy it looks as if there was only one\nkmd of kings. Now we are told about -good kings\nor figure-head kings, but why allow the latter, to\ngo about^ figure-heading at magnificent salaries?\nA good king or a figure-head king certainly doesn't\nmake democracy any more than a bad one, and it\nw\u00b0uldbe much better for the world if we could\nread of them only in histories.

Mr.\nMcKenzie, on his vacation, made a trip\nto Minneapolis and St Paul and thrqugh\nthe grain growing states on this side\nof the line. He stopped off at Fargo\nto leam sometljing about the Nonpar\ntisan^ League, whose fame has spread\nthrough Canada.\nFIGHT OF\nVCANADIAN\n\"The government-owned system of terminals\nis giving: the utmost satisfaction to farmers and\nthere is little criticism about it from any class of\npeople, now that it is an accomplished fact and no\nlonger a mere plan or experiment\" Public\nownership of terminals has been found the way to\nbetter market conditions in Canada. State owner\nship is the logical thing in North Dakota.\nFARMERS\nRESEMBLES U. S. SITUATION\nThe visitor told of the battles, victories\nand defeats of the producers on the other\n'side of the international border. The\nfight there has been much the same as\non this side of the line\u2014it has been a\nfight of the producers for a fair market\nand fair laws against intrenched privil\nege, the grain exchanges, railroads and\ncapitalists. While the spme forces have\nbeen lined up in Canada against each\nother the fanners are coming into their\nown there in a different way and have\n-progressed a lot further than they have\nin the United StatesT\nMr. McKenzie said:\n\"The Dominion government now owns\nte terminal elevator of 3,500,000 bushels\ncapacity at Port Arthur* on Lake Super\nior, a 2,000,000 bushel interior elevator\nat Moose Jaw, one of the same size at\nSaskatoon and is now constructing a\n1,000,000 bushel terminal elevator at\njgwa\nS5\u00abS: rar\nSsi'saSS\n1\n'wrw:\n\u2022T^SSf ^pSSgsS^ir^^Uiir\nVancouver, on the Pacific coast, to afford\na grain outlet in that direction.\n\"This government-owned system of\nterminals is giving the utmost satisfac\ntion to farmers and there is little criti\ncism about it from any. class of people,\nnow that it is an accomplished fact and\nno longer a mere plan or experiment.\nThe ownership by the government of\nthese terminal facilities has demon\nstrated that it is the only way they\nshould be owned and a-movement is now\non to have the government take over all\nthe present privately-owned grain term\ninals at Port Arthur and Fort William\non Lake Superior, -so that all grain will\noe handled through publicly owned\nelevators. At least the government will\nhave to build some more terminal\nelevators, the demandv for them is so\ngreat, but since there are enough\nterminals now built to handle all, the\ngrain no more should be built, but the\npresent ones privately owned should be\ntaken over by the government. This will\nundoubtedly be done in time.\nGRAIN EXCHANGE STARTS\nFIGHT AGAINST FARMERS\n\"Our fight against marketing con\nditions began in 1903 when the Manitoba\nGrain Growers' association was started.\nThis association originally did what'it\ncould to aid the farmer in marketing\nand it enabled farmers to combine their\norders for supplies and to buy them\ncooperatively in carload lots. But in\n1906 the Grain Growers' Grain company\nwas organized to handle the grain\nmarketing end of the business\" for the\nassociation. Then we began a fight\nsimilar to the fight your Society of\nEquity had on its hands when it organ-\nThe grain speculator in Canada fought to regain domination of the mar\nket, just as they are doing in the American Northwest. The farmers won in\nCanada. How? By getting the power of the government behind them. The\nfarmers of the Northwest have failed in their fight so far. They haven't\nhad the state and national governments with them. Political organization\n-that's the answer.\nElevators Win in Canada\nSlprr'iEW\nA western Canada bonanza crop in the shoek.\nGovernment Ownership Succeeds, Says\nMcKenzie, Pioneer in Fight of Farmers\nA, western \"Canada threshing scene\nized the Equity Cooperative exchange.\n\"At first the Grain Growers' company\nWas\nallowed to buy a.seal on the Win\nnipeg Grain exchange, corresponding to\nyour Chamber of Commerce at Minne\napolis. We paid $2500 for the seat and\nproceeded to market the grain of the\nfarmers .shipped us like a private\nbrokerage firm would market it. We\nwere regular members of the exchange.\nBut when the exchange members saw\nwhat an opening they were giving the\nfarmers through ownership of this seat\non the exchange, they kicked us out\u2014\ntook our membershin away.\n\"We were then left without any means\nof marketing our grain and faced a\nserious crisis. The Winnipeg exchange\nhas rules much the same as the Cham\nber of Commerce at Minneapolis and it\ncontrolled the whole grain business.\nNobody would buy of us -after we lost\nour seat. Unlike the, Equity at St.\nPaul we could find no market for our\ngrain among independent, interior mil\nlers, for there were no such millers.\nAll markets were'closed to us.\nFARMERS STAN J) TOGETHER\nAND BEAT SPECULATORS\n\"In this crisis we appealed to the\ngovernment, where the justice of our\nplea was finally realized. The govern\nment ordered the Winnipeg Grain\nexchange to restore us our-membership.\nThis did not end the fight, however. The\n\"^^PAGB NINE Jbatlm Ow\nHerd of Jerseys on a Canadian farm\nexchange then tried to ruin us in anothfflS\nway. The rule of the exchange was\nthat each broker handling wheat should\ncharge one cent per bushel commission^\nThe exchange repealed this rule for a\nyear, so that members of the exchange\ncould handle grain at cut rates or for\nnothing, thus attracting business away\nfrom the farmers' company, which had\nto get a certain fee, of course, or if\ncouldn't exist. They figured they had\nlots of money and could stand a loss for\na year in cut-throat competition against\nus,- but that we did not have enough'\nmoney to stand this kind of a fight and\nwould have to quit.\n\"However, we took the matter up witK\nour stockholders and they decided to\nstand pat, allowing our company to con.\"\ntinue to charge the one-cent brokerage\nfee, regardless of what the other\nmembers of the exchange charged*\nWell, this kind of a dirty fight on us\nhelped our cause and that year we\ndoubled our business, handling 16,000,000\nbushels of grain for the farmers, against\nless than 7,000,000 the year before*\n-.-v.rr'S'n^\n%SiS\u00bb\u00bb\n''I\u00ae1Wl\nTHREE SEATS\"ON EXCHANGE :fj\nNOW OWNED BY GROWERS\n\"This year the Grain Growers' Grain\ncompany will handle 40,000,000 bushels,\ndespite the small crop.

Far as We Casa Foresee,\nthe Geographic Problems\nof the CoEntiiaex&t Will\nHeed the Explorer for\nCJeiaeratioE&s to Come\"\nBy\nCYRUS C. ADAMS\nOf the American Geographical Society's Staff\nand First President of the Department\nof Geography, BrooKlyn Institute\nof Arts and Sciences\nThe ends of the Earth were our portion,\nThe ocean at large was our share.\nThere was never a skirmish to windward\nBut the Leaderless Legion was there:\nWe preach in advance of the Army,\n\\\\ e skirmish ahead of the Church,\nWith never a gun-boat to help us\nWhen we're scuppered and left in the lurch.\n?Kipling.\nFOUR centuries and fourteen years ago Columbus\ndiscovered America. Yet America is not fully\ndiscovered to-day. What happened when the\ncaravels of the Spaniard grounded on an American\nstrand was the kindling of a point of light in a\ndarkest continent. A century later the illumination\nwas still confined to the Gulf of Mexico. By 1700\nit had crept along the outline of the Atlantic sea\nboard. In another century it had barel/ reached\nthe Missouri, midway of the continent. Up to\nsixty years ago. three hundred and fifty years after\nColumbus had lighted the match, half of the con\ntinent was as little known as most of Africa is to-day.\nFifteen years ago Dr. G. M. Dawson the geologist\nestimated the unexplored parts of Canada\nas amounting to nearly a million square\nmiles. To-day they probably aggregate\nabout two hundred thousand. Apart from\nSouth America, which is probably the least\nknown of all the grand divisions of the\nglobe, there are still blank spaces on the\nmaps of the United States, Canada and\nMexico.\nWithin our own territory the only large\ntracts of unknown land are in Alaska.\nThere the gold discoveries have stimulated\nexploration to a surprising extent. Within\nthe last two or three years its uncharted\nregions have been traversed and greatly\nreduced. Yet some still remain. In 1900\na map of Alaska would have shown a large\nlozenge-shaped tract in the center of the\npeninsula untrodden and unknown. To-day\nthat tract would be split in two and its\nborders greatly contracted. In another\nyear or two it will be still further reduced;\nbut its ultimate disappearance is remote.\nIt will be long before it can be said that\nevery square mile from the mouth of the\nMackenzie to the mouth of the Yukon has been\nthoroughly explored.\nEven within the United States proper there is\nstill room for what may be called primary explo\nration. The impassioned zeal of the explorer finds ;\nan occasional opportunity yet. There are a few\nspots remaining in every State from Maine to Texas\nwhich will not be fully explored in years to come.\nThe topographical survey reduced the list by one\nlast year when it mapped Death Valley. Little\nblotches there still are, scattered over the entire\nland. Part of the Mojave desert in Arizona, patches\namong the mountains in Nevada, bits of Florida,\nstretches along the Washington boundary, corners\nin Western Virginia and neglected spaces in Maine\nare left to be traversed. They are almost trivial\nin extent, but there they are.\nSo much of primary exploration. Of secondary\nexploration there is an infinite amount to be done.\n\"Scarcely one-third of our whole territory,\" says\nProfessor Shaler, \"is yet, from the point of view of\nwhat is termed modern geography, even fairly\nwell understood.\" Of ottr public land alone there\nremains unsurveyed 550.376.113 acres. It is still\nimpossible to locate with precision the position\nof hundreds of towns in the United States. This\ndoes not mean that they cannot be reached by\nroad and railway, but that their geographical posi\ntion is still a matter of conjecture owing to the fact\nthat the points by which their position must be\ndetermined have not yet been laid down by scientific\nsurvey methods. Many of our mountains are still\nunmeasured. Much of great importance yet re\nmains to be learned of our Western rivers and\nwatersheds, upon which will depend the plans for\nirrigating those regions, which are already under\nway. In fact, there is field enough for the most\nenthusiastic explorer if he is only willing to turn Jiis\nattention to details.\nIn Canada the completion of Columbus's work\nis still a long way off. There are still areas of ill\ndefined extent in Labrador and on the borders of\nAlaska and considerable stretches around Hudson\nBay which await the explorer's foot and the sur\nveyor's level.\nLast summer Captain Amundsen completed the\nNorthwest Passage, and the same season some\nforty thousand American farmers crossed into\nCanada to take up land in the Northwest. To the\naverage man the two facts will seem to have no\nrelation. But in reality they are closely akin. The\nexploit of Captoin Amundsen sharpened the line\nof our knowledge, dispelled some of the thin remain\ning mist about the northern boundaries of Canada.\nAnd every advance of the line of exploration means\na corresponding advance in the line of settlement\nwhich follows it. There is a sound relation between\nthe exploits of Amundsen and - Fiala and that by\nHubbard (heroically completed by his widow) and\nthe growth of immigration into Canada. Not that\nlast season's crop of immigrants had anything to\nUnexplored Sections Shaded blacK.\ndo with their adventures; the fruits of these new\nexploits will be reaped a decade hence.\nIt might be interesting to work out the gain to\nCanada due to each heroic venture upon her borders,\nand an imaginative clerk might draw up an ex post\nfacto prospectus showing exactly how many millions\nwere gained for the Dominion by the journeys\nof Ogilvie in the Yukon, Low in Labrador, and the\nTyrrell brothers in the Barren Lands. When they\nand their predecessors exposed the fatuitv of that\nGovernor of the Hudson Bay Company who swore\nthat the prairies of Manitoba were nntit for human\nhabitation, they set in motion a procession which\nis still marching northward.\nBut Canada will find no more great wheat-fields.\nOf the thirteen extensive regions within the Do\nminion which Dr. Dawson outlined roughly in 1S90,\nnone remains unexplored within the Temperate\nZone, and there is no reasonable prospect of an\nother occurrence like that of the Peace River ex\nploration. When the agents of the Hudson Bay\nCompany described the Canadian Northwest, they\ndrew in a low range of mountains covering a con\nsiderable part of what is now Alberta and Saskatche\nwan. The mountains appeared on the maps for a\nconsiderable period, but when the tide of travel\nset in that direction they could not be found. The\nerror was easily explained. The agents of the com\npany had traversed that country only by water,\nand the chief thoroughfare was the Peace River\nwhich had for a great part of its length cut a channel\nfrom one to two thousand feet deep, making a vast\ncanon. Looking up against these bluffs, the\nvoyagers concluded that the region was mountain\nous, and the disproof of their report was like\nfinding a new Province.\nThere is no prospect of such a reversal\nof judgment about any remaining portion\nof Canada's territory. Enough trustworthy\ninformation is already in hand to determine\nthe character of all these regions. Along\nthe Arctic coast east and west of the Mac\nkenzie River there are extensive lands\nabout which little is known except that\nthey are believed to contain vast copper\ndeposits, and it is probable that Amundsen's\nrecent journey may facilitate the develop\nment of these regions. Farther east around\nthe shores of Hudson Bay there lie vast\nareas, apparently unfit for cultivation, if\neven for habitation; but there is prospect\nof further discoveries of lumber and much\ngreater development of fisheries. For this\nthe Canadian Government is already mak\ning provision and has established a regular\nstation at Cape Fullerton and a Govern\nment patrol service.\nLabrador offers probably the largest\nstretch of country on the mainland which\nis still unknown. What little knowledge we have of\nthe country indicates that the prospect for the de\nvelopment of agriculture is slight, that there is little\nvaluable lumber there and no brilliant prospects of\nmineral wealth. It is of c ourse reasonable to suppose\nthat some further mineral deposits will be found in\nLabrador, and the geological conditions indicate that\nores like those of Tilt Cove in Newfoundland and\nSudbury in Ontario may be found; but Labrador\nhas so far been a discouraging region. The coast\nhas hitherto been more productive than the interior.\nThe fisheries continue to grow in importance and\nthe great natural beauty of the shore, rivaling the\ncoast of Norway in the number and depth of its\nfiords, offers a strong lure to adventurous spirits.\nMuch of the coast is imperfectly charted. The\ninterior of Newfoundland is also comparatively\nunknown, but the indications there leave no room\nfor expecting more than a moderate agricultural de\nvelopment. The timber on the island appears to be\nof a stunted growth, and there remain only two pos", "batch": "dlc_weimaraner_ver02", "title_normal": "evening star.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1906-03-18/ed-1/seq-31.json", "place": ["District of Columbia--Washington"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 33, "county": [null], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83045462/1923-06-06/ed-1/seq-33/", "subject": ["Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505", "Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Washington"], "date": "19230606", "title": "Evening star.

S N., wroto a book\ncalled \"Tho Jnlluenco of S a Power\nUpon History.\" In It ho developed a\nnew pluloo phy and a new Interpreta\ntion of historical vents. Ho declared\nthat nations earn; into power In the\nalmost exact latio that they evolved\n-lii IIln and naval resources. Ho laid\nit down as axiomatic that power on\nthe m a was quivaleiit to power as a\nnation.\nThe book w offod at, particular\nly by certain ftpostlcs of insularity in\nthe United Stat s who were then\nshouting \"no entangling alliances\"\nand \"no rhip subsidy\" at the top of\ntheir voices. Among tho.-e who\ntho.ighr the book signithant, however,\nv. a tho German emperor. He then\nwa: n young man, and in his aspira\ntions for Germar: world empire his\nthoughts were turning tow;crd. tho\nFoven Mas. Tho more the kaiser read\nthe l ook tho more lie liked it, and he\nwas largely responsible for giving- its\ntremendous vogue, lie made it a part\nof the courso of reading for all Ger\nman naval cadets, praised tlio volume\nwherever he went and sent a personal\nJetter of congratulation to Admiral\nMahan himself.\nGerm of German Navy.\nThe Influence of Sea Power Upon\nHistory\" was, according to critics, the\n.perm of the modern German navy.\nITom tho moment that the German\nemperor accepted Its basic philosophy,\nGermany began to build great iron\nclads, nntl within a decade she had\nall Kngland expanding1 her naval bud\npets to a point where a great popular\noutcry against such increased taxation\nnearly threw the present liberal move\nment out of power. Great 1 1 ri tain did\nnot know that Mahan's book was be\nhind tho unprecedented German na\nval Increases, or probably the genial\nAmerican naval officer would not\nhavo become aa -popular in England as\n\"wa3 tho case.\nGermany accepted the Mahan phil\nosophy and with the. Increase in her\nnavy camo her mighty campaign to\nbuild tip foreign trade, a campaign\nthat was successful, he built up her\nmanufactures to a point where her\nagricultural resources were pushed In\nto tho 'background, and where the\nlabel, \"Mado In Germany,\" became\nknown all over tho world. One of the\nresults of the comparative decline of\nagriculture was that she became to\nsortie extent dependent on her over\nseas carrying trade for her food sup\nply. S,ho became a large importer of\ngrains and cercal3 from tho United\nstates and Russia. As her population\nadvanced, and manufacturing became\nthe keystone of her wealth and pow\ner, her self-sustaining resources dwin\ndled. All Sources Cut Off.\nNow her normal sources of food\nsupply are cut off, and sdie is alto\ngether dependent upon her own agri\nculture, as was tho caso In tho 70's\nand SO'c. Not only that, .but her great\nforeign trade, tho dominant feature of\nher wealth, ig entirely gone. The Brit\nish control of the seas has scoured the\nocean clean of the last German mer\nchantman. Is this the result of the\nkaiser's accepting this Mahan philoso\nphy? Many critics of international affairs\nFay it is. They declare that Germany,\nin developing a great foreign trade,\ncame into direct and vital competition\nwith Great Britain, and that she drew\ndown her challenge to tho Jatter na\ntion beforo she was ready to do so.\nOnly in tho event that Germany de\nstroys tho British fleet can sho win\nthe war, regardless of tho tide of con\nflict on land,\nTho success of the German \"paper\nblockade\" ,t England might, and\n.probably would, bo tho turning point\nof the war. If Germany could do to\nthe English carrying trade what her\ngreat rival has already done to her\ntrade, tho end of tho war is In sight.\nGermany Is partially dependent upon\nother nations for her foodstuffs; Eng\nJ land Is entirely so. Should Great Bri\ntain be Isolated from her colonies or\nfrom' tho United States, her popula\ntion would bo starving and asking for\npeace terms within a month.\nPhilosophy Got Tost.\nClearly the Mahan phllosophj cm\nbraces the fact that Foa power Is not\nFufficicnt to bring a nation into an\nundisputed position of wealth and\nstrength; sho must have tho supremo\nsea. power. So far tho German navy,\npowerful as it 1?, buas been as negligi\nble almost as If It woro non-existent;\nand that becauso the English navy is\npo much larger. Submarines may\nchange the present status. The events,\nof tho next fens- weeks will not only\ndetermine tho ultimate issue of the\nwar, but also make or break the Ma\nhan philosophy of history. At the\npresent moment, control of the sea-; is\ntho \"open sesame\" to world power.\nSHOWS\nFile 10 GOOD\nc\nManufaclurcrs' Bulletin De\nclares U- S.

It comes after\nthe United States, Great Britain\nand Russia. (China lags behind it\nindustrially.) Its air force is an\nImportant factor in the war against\nthe U-boat.\nThe war has shown Canada its\nstrength and potentialities. It is\nbeginning to spread its influence in\ndependently around the world. It\nrecently has opened legations in\nArgentina. Brazil and Chile, where\nformerly its interests were repre\nsented by Great Britain. It is rep\nresented in Washington not only by\na large legation, but also by dele\ngations from its War Trade Board.\nMunitions Ministry and its chiefs of\netaff.\nCritic of Policy.\nCanada has been a consistent\ncritic of United Nations\u2019 diplomacy\nduring the last two years of the\ntendency of the powers known as\nthe \u201cbig four\u2019\u2019\u2014United States, Brit\nain, Russia and China\u2014to insist on\ntaking the lead in making decisions\naffecting aU the Allies. In some\nways Canada has been the most out\nspoken of the small powers against\n\u201cbig fourism.\u2019\u2019\nThe strongest signs of Canada's\nambition are the Dominion\u2019s recent\ninsistence\u2014unsuccessful so far\u2014\nthat it be represented on the Cen\ntral Committee of the United Na\ntions Relief and Rehabilitation Or\nganization, and its suggestion that\nthe Allies put aside the American\nWhite and the British Keynes plans\nfor world currency stabilization and\naccept instead a plan that was\nframed in Ottawa.\nCanada is demanding an equal\nvoice with Great Britain in United\nNations\u2019 decisions today, whereas in\nthe first years of the war the Do\nminion simply was asking London\nwhat it could do to help the old\ncountry out with the war.\nHoms aey Air rosiuon.\nGreat Britain is moving slowly\nabout the adoption of a postwar\ncommercial air policy because Can\nada insists that its special interests\nbe protected. Canada is strategic\nally located geographically as an\nairline base across the Atlantic be\ntween North America and Europe.\nIt is strategically placed also for\ntranspolar flight if that transporta\ntion route ever is put into operation.\nThe growing Canadian sense of\nits individuality and sovereignty may\nhave far-reaching effect on this\ncountry. Canada in the past has\nbeen one of our chief customers, and\nthis country has been the principal\nbuyer of Canadian products. Po\nlitically, Britain probably will leel\nthe Canadian tendency more strong\nly than the United States.\nThe dominion to the north is tra\nditionally a great agricultural na\ntion. but the war has given an im\npetus to industry there, and Wash\nington finds indications that Canada\nwill want to retain its industrial\npower. Industrialization would\nchange the nature of Canada as a\nmarket for United States products.\nIts factories now make about $4.\n000,000,000 worth of goods each year.\nFavors Peace Organization.\nThe government of Mackenzie\nKing strongly favors an interna\ntional organization to preserve the\npeace, and that government can be\nexpected to make positive sugges\ntions of its own for the mechanics\nand operation of the organization.\nPrime Minister Mackenzie King\nalready has presented the parlia\nment in Ottawa with his thoughts\non \"functional representation\u201d on\nInternational bodies. He pointed\nout that the League of Nations was\nawkward because every member had\na vote on every topic. He urged that\nin place of such universality of vot\ning, powers that have major in\nterests be allowed to vote on ques\ntions respecting those interests.\nThus, Canada would always be\npermitted to vote on questions con\ncerning food. Canada is destined\nto play a large part in the food\nphase of European and Asiatic re\nhabilitation after the war. French\nCanadians, still isolationist, can be\nexpected probably to question this\npolicy. King's political position is\nconsidered safe despite his recent\nsetback in the Ontario elections.\nThe Commonwealth Federation\nparty which made progress in the\nOntario balloting is the strongest\nforce for \u201cCaiyda First\u201d in the\ndominion. The Conservative party,\nwhich has no prospects, is still de\nvoted to the Union Jack and sub\nservient attachment to Britain.\nQuebec\n\u2019Continued From First Page.)\ntheir names never will be released,\nso as to avoid any disclosures which\nmight be useful to the enemy.\nArrangements have been com\npleted to receive the American Chief\nExecutive here shortly for his sixth\nformal war council with Prime Min\nister Churchill.\n(Don Iddon, London Daily Mail\ncorrespondent, suggested in a dis\npatch from Quebec that Gen.\nDwight D. Eisenhower may at\ntend the meeting and added that\nhe might already be in Canada,\nthough he said this could not be\nconfirmed.\n(\"There is a growing impres\nsion in Quebec that Allied leaders\nand the military staff are waiting\nfor something and some one\u2014\nnot just President Roosevelt.\u201d\nMr. Iddon wrote. \u2018\u2018It may be they\nare waiting for Eisenhower.\u201d)\nSecrecy is Rule.\nIn previous meetings of President\nRoosevelt and Prime Minister\nChurchill, starting with the one two\nyears ago at which they formulated\nthe Atlantic Charter, secrecy has\nbeen the rule. There were no ad\nvance announcements and strict\ncensorship control prevailed.\nBut this time the entire pattern\nwas changed. It was pretty much\nof a certainty that Mr. Churchill\nagain was coming across the At\nlantic. His arrival in Quebec was\nannounced. The press was allowed\nto state that he and Mr. Roosevelt\nhad held a preliminary conference\nat the President\u2019s home at Hyde\nPark, N. Y., and that American\nchiefs of staff were here to confer\nwith British staff chiefs.\nCensorship restrictions on move\nments of the Chief Executive were\nlifted to permit advance disclosure\nthat he was coming here for the\nwar parleys. This was the first\ntime since the United States went\nto war that such liberty had been\nallowed the press.\nThe policy apparently has been\none of encouraging all sorts of\nspeculation on what was going on\nin this ancient provincial capital\nand on what was likely to occur.\nFor the United States, Britain\nand Canada, there are few spots re\nmaining for attacks except against\nthe European continent itself. They\ncould go into Sardina or Corsica,\nbut it is considered more likely here\nthat assaults would be directed\nacross the English Channel, at Nor\nj way or the lowlands, or at Italy.\nThrough blows at any or all of\nthose areas, the United Nations\ncould take full advantage of Rus\n! sia\u2019s mighty drives on her central\nfront. And if that full advantage\n1 is to be attained, strategy consider\nations would seem to dictate that\nthe operations be undertaken in the\nrelatively near fuure.\nWeather Favorable.\nThus they could help guarantee a\ncontinuation of the gains of Rus\nsian arms, and they could make\nthe greatest use of mounting Allied\ni air superiority while weather con\nditions over the continent are most\nI favorable to raising a protective\nI umbrella of planes.\nAll these factors point toward the\nidea that Allied plans for new on\nslaughts already have been drawn\u2014\n' and not here at the Quebec con\n; ference. since months of prepara\ntion are required to get supplies\n| and equipment and men to the\njumping ofT places.\nThe conference here, then, would\nappear to be concerned with re\nchecking those plans and making\nany needed alterations in the light\nof the swift pace the United Na\n; tions armies have set in Russia and\nthe Mediterranean since Mr.\nRoosevelt and Mr. Churchill met\nlast in Washington In May.\nChurchill Denies Predicting\nWar\u2019s End by Christmas\nBy the Associated Press.\nQUEBEC, Aug. 17.\u2014An official\nBritish spokesman said yesterday at\ni press conference that Prime Min\nister Churchill wished to deny a\nstatement attributed to him that\nthe war would be over by Christmas.\nThe statement was published by\ntwo French-language newspapers,\nLe Canada of Montreal and L\u2019Action\nCatholique of Quebec.
